@claude -> Please make sure that all mentioned notes below make sense align with current platform/website direction

Create prompting techniques and keywords to use to achieve specific outcomes - Put in Strive drive (will be useful when building prompt engineer agent & other agents)

Free trial for Sai platform (intelligent business platform) should be limited requests and cheaper models - Be transparent about this  - Offer each tier of user a more powerful model with more tools and capabilities

Offer basic dashboard to tier 1 users, more customized dashboard (industry specific) for tier 2, and tier 3 (enterprise) gets a fully customized dashboard for their specific company and workflows and tools

Role play which allows users to role play their specific roles: Sales, CEO (negotiations & PR), VP (conversation with their boss), etc. - This would be a really good tool to offer with Sai for intelligent business platform

Tiers -> Tier 1: $299-$499  best for Solopreneurs & Startups, Tier 2: $699-$1,000 best for SMEs & niched markets/industries or people who want accelerated growth, Tier 3: Enterprise - Custom pricing and best for businesses who need fully customized Sai and full Agentic workflows & teams (this could also be very helpful for start ups and solo entrepreneurs that need specific solutions and tools)

Super important to pre-prompt Sai or subagents to be critical and unbiased when doing reviews and or testing (this is important for internal use and for building certain agents or tools for business platform)

Joshy (Embur) -> Educates all businesses and people on how to use the platform

Secret weapon - AI evals: Where LLMs review a company and also to see if an LLM even knows about the existence of a company (could offer a SEO type service within this eval process) - Watch: https://youtu.be/TL527yTpxlk?si=DB6dfGrSo_3peSBj

Create “Investors” & “Partners” page on website -> make accessible on the Our Company page and put on home page
