Core Dashboards and Pages for a Multi-Industry "Intelligent Business HUB" SaaS
As a seasoned software engineer who's architected several SaaS platforms serving diverse industries (from tech startups to manufacturing giants), I'll brainstorm a comprehensive set of dashboards and pages tailored to your multi-industry focus. The goal is to create a versatile "hub" that adapts to various business sizes, sectors (e.g., retail, healthcare, finance, tech, services), and leadership roles (e.g., CEOs needing high-level overviews, department heads requiring granular tools).
I'll structure this by core modules (building on your CRM and CMS), each with suggested dashboards/pages, key features, and why they're valuable across industries. This ensures modularity—users can enable/disable modules based on their needs. Prioritize user roles with customizable permissions (e.g., via Supabase auth) and AI-driven insights (e.g., predictive analytics) to live up to the "Intelligent" name.
Aim for a clean UI: A main navigation sidebar with module icons, a global search, and personalized home dashboard. Use responsive design in Next.js for mobile access.

Implementation Tips

Prioritization: Start with CRM/CMS as your MVP, then add Analytics for the "Intelligent" edge. Use modular routing in Next.js (e.g., /crm/dashboard, /finance/invoices).
Cross-Industry Adaptability: Make fields customizable (e.g., custom CRM fields for healthcare vs. retail). Include templates for industries.
Leadership Focus: Role-based dashboards—e.g., CEO gets a "Bird's Eye View" aggregating all modules.
AI Enhancements: Embed ML for predictions, chatbots for queries, using libraries like TensorFlow.js or external APIs.
Scalability/Cost: Leverage Supabase for real-time (e.g., dashboard updates); keep SMS optional to minimize Twilio costs.
