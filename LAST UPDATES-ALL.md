# Last Update Sessions

# 1
Request Free Demo at bottom of home page doesn't work. -> This button should take users to the requests page

Fix solution page dropdown menu for filter to be formatted correctly (you can notice some badges are bigger or look weird because certain filter buttons aren't aligned or are different sizes)

Two blog post cards are still showing up when any subfilter is selected - MUST FIX, this hasn't been able to be resolved in multiple sessions

Subfilter system is still using all tags to provide a filter system rather than by topic or industry or any other identifiers - Have to fix this for easier UX

# 2

See if it's possible to autofill the users calendly information with their information from the fillout forms so users don't have to fill out their information more than once.
    - Additional context - This was already implemented in a previous session so please just double check how it's set up and make sure that it works.

Fix Solutions page filter issue: When "All Industries" is selected as the filter and all Industry cards are being shown, it says "0" in the filter button rather than actually counting the total number of industry cards in total.

Brush up the brochure and make it finalized and a professional top tier brochure - Currently a lot of text color blends in with background color so it's blending in and can't be seen

For now, remove all whitepapers on that section of the resources page. Only have the main whitepaper which is currently feature which will be the Strive Tech whitepaper once we finalize it. So go ahead and rename it and put a brief whitepaper description using the information currently located on the website to cater it specifically to Strive

Fix industry cards on solutions page - Currently they look average and kinda weird with the orange tinted color. I like the cards formatting and layout, I just want to change the color scheme that's being used (maybe inverse of the solution cards?) - Also, the industry cards should have pop-out cards when clicked on just like the solution cards - Give quality information for each industry card and go into detail. You can also use pain points which are mentioned on the home page and even in the specific industry case studies

Update all sources for case studies

Create full pages for case studies - currently linked through the "sources" section on pop-out cards
    - Create "view full case study" button for users to see full case study in pop-out card
    - Make sure ALL case studies are actually relevant to the industry theyre linked to (check government and legal - one of the two current case study articles isn't linked to industry)
    - Validate all case study links (use claude walkthrough folders/files and perplexity to validate)
Change generic stock photos that don't match topics or categories (some cards still don't have photos)

# 4

Upload Whitepaper and finish resource page feature section

Make sure email templates are good to go and database is fully operational on all form submissions

See if main domain is finally working and if not, find solution. Try deleting the project and remaking it. (Ask claude before doing this to troubleshoot)

AI/ML Frameworks on the Tools & Tech section on the Resource page is still showing no content when selected in the subfilter... Is this correct? I feel like there's content missing for this subfiliter. Please Investigate and see what's going wrong please.

# Chat bot fixes (in other dev environment)

Chat bot project - Fix chatbot CTA buttons to take users to the request page or assessment pages (Add a calendly option at the end of contact form which appears after the user has submitted the contact form) - Need to change one of the CTA buttons to "Request Showcase" which takes the user to the request page


Fix browser caching issue (check claude desktop chat)

Fix home page hero section chatbot iframe (currently way too small and is not formatted correctly for all devices)

Fix chatbot-sai page, the window is small on laptop so try to make sure it's formatted/configured properly on all devices
