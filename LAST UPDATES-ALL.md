# Last Update Sessions

# 1

Fix solution page dropdown menu text and icon color to always be orange (it's already orange on hover effect) - This will help with UX 

Change Inddustry cards on Solutions page to be the same gradient color as the fill out forms on the Requests page - Make the button collors the same color as the orange buttons as well - Keep text color scheme the same on all industry cards on the solutions page

Subfilter system for blog posts is not configured correctly, it shows multiple categories with numbers but there isn't any content/cards that appear ("AI & Machine Learning
" & "Technology & Tools" & "Tutorials & Guides") 
    - This same issue is occuring on the "Tools & Tech" main filter. AI/ML Frameworks shows "8" but nothing appears when the subfilter button is selected.

# 2

See if it's possible to autofill the users calendly information with their information from the fillout forms so users don't have to fill out their information more than once.
    - Additional context - This was already implemented in a previous session so please just double check how it's set up and make sure that it works.

Brush up the brochure and make it finalized. All that needs to be done is editing the text color. Make sure any text color that's used isn't the same color as the background. Currently a lot of the text color (mainly headings & titles) blends in with the background.


# 3

Update all sources for case studies

Create full pages for case studies - currently linked through the "sources" section on pop-out cards
    - Create "view full case study" button for users to see full case study in pop-out card
    - Make sure ALL case studies are actually relevant to the industry theyre linked to (check government and legal - one of the two current case study articles isn't linked to industry)
    - Validate all case study links (use claude walkthrough folders/files and perplexity to validate)
Change generic stock photos that don't match topics or categories (some cards still don't have photos)

# 4

Upload Whitepaper and finish resource page feature section

Make sure email templates are good to go and database is fully operational on all form submissions

# Chat bot fixes (in other dev environment)

Chat bot project - Fix chatbot CTA buttons to take users to the request page or assessment pages (Add a calendly option at the end of contact form which appears after the user has submitted the contact form) - Need to change one of the CTA buttons to "Request Showcase" which takes the user to the request page

Fix homepage chatbot window to be smaller and to fit on all screens and devices

Fix home page hero section chatbot iframe (currently way too small and is not formatted correctly for all devices)

Fix chatbot-sai page, the window is small on laptop so try to make sure it's formatted/configured properly on all devices

Change Chatbot-sai page to have chatbot be the center focus and maybe take out the hero section?
# Final fixes

Please go through all solutions and make adjustments, some of them need to be switched out (we currently have robotics -_-) 
    - After doing this we need to make sure that all industries have the right number of applicable solutions attached to them and the number is being shown in the dropdown filter

Change home page hero section for mobile to where the main header text is above the chatbot preview
Make sure mobile is completely optimized with all new content

Refactor entire codebase for easier maintenance. This is essential for when the site is converted to next.js and the user side is put into the site

# Case Studies

Nice tagline that I want to use: "Real, Verified Case Studies - Use only documented implementations from real companies with published results"
