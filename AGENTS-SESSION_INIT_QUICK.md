1. **Read project docs**: CLAUDE.md and AGENTS_HANDBOOK.md
2. **Review this chat log/task list**: [PASTE HERE]
3. **Create TodoWrite list** with agent assignments
4. **Use these priorities**:
   - ðŸ”´ Critical: Security, bugs, broken features
   - ðŸŸ¡ Important: New features, optimizations
   - ðŸŸ¢ Nice-to-have: Documentation, refactoring

**Auto-assign agents using PARALLEL EXECUTION (`+`)**:
- UI tasks â†’ `(frontend-developer + mobile-developer)` - Run in parallel
- API tasks â†’ `(backend-architect + database-optimizer)` - Run in parallel
- Bugs â†’ `(debugger + error-detective)` - Run in parallel
- Security â†’ `(security-auditor + mobile-security-coder)` - Run in parallel
- Unknown â†’ `search-specialist`

**Execute using slash commands when possible**:

- `/strive-security` - Security audit
- `/strive-dashboard` - Dashboard features
