# Strive Tech Use # - Admins & Employees = two user types for internal use
## Admins should be able to see all of the following dashboards while the employees should only be able see CRM, and Sales Modules/dashboards

Core Dashboards and Pages for Strive Tech when using the "Intelligent Business HUB" SaaS
As an experienced software engineer who's worked on AI-focused SaaS tools (including platforms for ML model management and data pipelines), I'll tailor a list of useful dashboards and pages specifically for your AI solutions company. This builds on the multi-industry framework we brainstormed earlier but customizes it to the unique needs of an AI firm—focusing on R&D, model development, client delivery, data ethics, and scaling AI products. Think of this as an internal configuration of your HUB: leveraging modules like CRM/CMS but adding AI-specific ones for roles like CTOs (tech oversight), data scientists (model building), project managers (client work), and executives (business metrics).
I'll structure it by core modules, with suggested dashboards/pages, key features, and why they're valuable for an AI company. Emphasize AI-driven insights (e.g., anomaly detection in datasets) to align with your "Intelligent" theme. Use Supabase for data storage, Prisma for queries, and integrate ML libs if needed (e.g., via API calls in Next.js).
Prioritize modularity: Allow team members to customize views, with real-time updates via Supabase Realtime. Start with high-impact modules like AI R&D and Client Projects for your MVP.
