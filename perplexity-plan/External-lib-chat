**Takeaways:**

- **You can build a full-featured portal using only free/open-source tech**, but you’ll need to self-host/manage updates, scaling, monitoring, and support.
- **Feature depth, scalability, and support** will be less compared to paid/cloud platforms.
- **Open-source alternatives may require more development effort and DevOps knowledge**—but they offer zero ongoing costs and complete ownership/control.

If your project is MVP/prototype or serving a limited user base, free tiers and open-source solutions will be effective. As you scale, migrate to paid managed services for reliability and enterprise features.
