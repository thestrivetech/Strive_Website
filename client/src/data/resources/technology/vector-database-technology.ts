  title: "Vector Database Technology",
  shortDescription: "Vector databases are specialized storage systems designed for high-dimensional vector data and similarity search operations. Essential for AI applications, they enable rapid semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by efficiently storing and querying embeddings from machine learning models.",
  fullDescription: "Intelligent document search, code search, and knowledge base systems with natural language queries. Personalized product, content, and service recommendations based on user behavior and preferences. Chatbots and AI assistants with enhanced context retrieval from private knowledge bases.",
