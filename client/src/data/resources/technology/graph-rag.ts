  title: "Graph RAG",
  shortDescription: "Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced AI architecture that enhances traditional RAG by incorporating knowledge graphs and graph-structured data. It enables superior reasoning over complex relationships, multi-hop queries, and hierarchical information structures for more accurate and contextually aware AI responses.",
  fullDescription: "Analyze complex business documents, legal contracts, and research papers requiring multi-document reasoning. Build intelligent enterprise search systems that understand organizational structures, processes, and relationships. Create AI assistants for financial analysis, regulatory compliance, and strategic planning that need to connect information across multiple sources and contexts.",
