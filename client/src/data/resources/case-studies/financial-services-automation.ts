  title: "Solo Agent Sarah Thompson: From Spreadsheet Chaos to 35% More Deals with SAI",
  shortDescription: "Solo agent Sarah Thompson closed 35% more deals and saved 12 hours weekly after consolidating 5 tools into SAI Platform, growing her GCI from $180K to $245K.",
  fullDescription: "Sarah Thompson, a solo residential agent in San Diego managing 500+ contacts, transformed her business by consolidating her entire tech stack into SAI Platform. Over 12 months, she replaced spreadsheets, Follow Up Boss, Canva, Mailchimp, and CoStar with SAI's unified CRM, The Office, Content Studio, and REID modules. The all-in-one platform automated her lead follow-ups, transaction checklists, marketing content, and property comps. SAI's Global AI assistant handled routine inquiries and generated listing descriptions in seconds. Results included 35% increase in closed deals (from 20 to 27 annually), 12 hours weekly time savings, $400/month software cost reduction, and $65K GCI growth (from $180K to $245K). Sarah's success demonstrates how solo agents can compete with large teams using the right technology.",
