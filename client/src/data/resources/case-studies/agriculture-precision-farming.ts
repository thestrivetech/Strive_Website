  title: "AI-Powered Precision Agriculture: $650M in Farmer Savings",
  shortDescription: "John Deere's computer vision revolution delivered 60% input reduction and $650M annual farmer savings across 468 million acres.",
  fullDescription: "This comprehensive case study examines John Deere's transformative $5.2B investment in agricultural AI, positioning them as the undisputed leader in precision agriculture. Their See & Spray technology represents the blueprint for AI implementation at unprecedented scaleâ€”750,000 connected machines processing billions of real-time data points through computer vision algorithms achieving 95%+ accuracy in plant-level decision making. The implementation resulted in $650 million in verified annual savings for US farmers, 60% reduction in chemical input costs, and 1.5-year average payback periods with documented ROI validation across diverse agricultural operations.",
