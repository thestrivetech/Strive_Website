# Next.js 15 Route Groups Critical Issue - Complete Fix Documentation

**Date:** September 28-29, 2025
**Issue:** Route groups `(auth)` and `(platform)` returning 404 errors in Next.js 15.5.4
**Resolution:** Successfully fixed by restructuring without route groups

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE SUMMARY

### The Problem
Next.js 15 with Turbopack was not recognizing route groups using parentheses syntax. All pages within `(auth)` and `(platform)` folders returned 404 errors, making the entire application inaccessible.

**Key Discovery:** Route groups had NEVER worked in this project since Session 2 when they were first created. This was a systemic issue, not a regression.

### Symptoms
- `/auth/login` → 404 Not Found
- `/dashboard` → 404 Not Found
- `/crm`, `/projects`, `/settings` → All 404
- Root `/` redirected to dashboard which then 404'd
- Test page at `/test` worked fine (proving regular routes worked)

---

## 📋 TROUBLESHOOTING JOURNEY

### Phase 1: Initial Discovery & Analysis
1. **Reviewed chat logs** from Sessions 2-3
   - Found note: "Module resolution issue with @supabase/ssr in middleware (package is installed but Turbopack can't resolve it)"
   - Confirmed route groups never actually worked

2. **Verified file structure was correct:**
   ```
   app/
   ├── (auth)/
   │   ├── layout.tsx
   │   └── login/
   │       └── page.tsx
   ├── (platform)/
   │   ├── layout.tsx
   │   ├── dashboard/page.tsx
   │   ├── crm/page.tsx
   │   ├── projects/page.tsx
   │   └── settings/page.tsx
   ```

### Phase 2: Attempted Fixes That FAILED

#### ❌ Fix Attempt 1: Lockfile Conflicts
**Issue Found:** Multiple lockfiles across the project
- `C:/Users/zochr/pnpm-lock.yaml` (user directory)
- `old/package-lock.json`
- `old/Strive-dashboard-MVP/project/package-lock.json`

**Action Taken:**
```bash
rm "C:/Users/zochr/pnpm-lock.yaml"
rm "C:/Users/zochr/Desktop/GitHub/Strive_Website/old/package-lock.json"
rm "C:/Users/zochr/Desktop/GitHub/Strive_Website/old/Strive-dashboard-MVP/project/package-lock.json"
```

**Result:** ❌ Route groups still didn't work

#### ❌ Fix Attempt 2: Tailwind CSS Errors
**Issue Found:** `border-border` utility class not recognized

**Files Fixed:**
- `components/layouts/sidebar/main-sidebar.tsx`
- `components/ui/floating-chat.tsx`
- `components/ui/chart.tsx`
- `app/globals.css`

**Changes:**
- Replaced `border-border` with `border`
- Changed `@apply border-border` to `border-color: hsl(var(--border))`

**Result:** ❌ Fixed CSS errors but route groups still didn't work

#### ❌ Fix Attempt 3: Next.js Configuration
**Added to next.config.ts:**
```typescript
experimental: {
  turbo: {
    root: './'
  }
}
```

**Result:** ❌ Route groups still didn't work

#### ❌ Fix Attempt 4: Switch from Turbopack to Webpack
**Ran without Turbopack:**
```bash
npx next dev  # Instead of next dev --turbopack
```

**Result:** ❌ Route groups still didn't work even with webpack

#### ❌ Fix Attempt 5: Update to Next.js Canary
**Updated Next.js:**
```bash
npm install next@canary  # Installed 15.6.0-canary.33
```

**Result:** ❌ Route groups still didn't work

#### ❌ Fix Attempt 6: Isolate Old Folder
**Theory:** The `old/` folder with duplicate Next.js projects might be interfering

**Action:**
```bash
mv old/ old_backup/
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Fixed some issues (test page started working, no more lockfile warnings)
- ❌ But route groups STILL didn't work

## ✅ THE SOLUTION THAT WORKED

### Option 1 from route-error-fix.md: Remove Route Groups

Since route groups fundamentally didn't work in this setup, the solution was to move all pages out of route groups into regular folders.

#### Step 1: Move Auth Pages
```bash
cd app
mv "app/(auth)/login" app/login
mv "app/(auth)/layout.tsx" app/auth-layout-backup.tsx
rmdir "app/(auth)"
```

#### Step 2: Move Platform Pages
```bash
mv "app/(platform)/dashboard" app/dashboard
mv "app/(platform)/crm" app/crm
mv "app/(platform)/projects" app/projects
mv "app/(platform)/settings" app/settings
mv "app/(platform)/layout.tsx" app/platform-layout-backup.tsx
rmdir "app/(platform)"
```

#### Step 3: Clean Up
```bash
rm -rf app/test  # Remove test page created during troubleshooting
rm -rf .next     # Clear Next.js cache
```

#### Step 4: Update Middleware
**File:** `app/middleware.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD
const redirectUrl = new URL('/auth/login', request.url);
if (user && path.startsWith('/auth/')) {

// NEW
const redirectUrl = new URL('/login', request.url);
if (user && path === '/login') {
```

#### Step 5: Install Missing Dependencies
**Error discovered:** Login page was missing dependencies
```bash
npm install zod @radix-ui/react-label
```

#### Step 6: Restart Dev Server
```bash
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

## 🎯 VERIFICATION & RESULTS

### Test Commands & Expected Results
```bash
# Test login page
curl -I http://localhost:3001/login
# Result: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ✅

# Test dashboard (should redirect to login when not authenticated)
curl -I http://localhost:3001/dashboard
# Result: HTTP/1.1 307 → /login?redirect=%2Fdashboard ✅

# Test root (should redirect to dashboard)
curl -I http://localhost:3001/
# Result: HTTP/1.1 307 → /dashboard ✅
```

### Final Working Structure
```
app/
├── login/           # Moved from (auth)/login
├── dashboard/       # Moved from (platform)/dashboard
├── crm/            # Moved from (platform)/crm
├── projects/       # Moved from (platform)/projects
├── settings/       # Moved from (platform)/settings
├── auth-layout-backup.tsx     # Preserved from (auth)/layout.tsx
├── platform-layout-backup.tsx  # Preserved from (platform)/layout.tsx
└── middleware.ts   # Updated to use /login instead of /auth/login
```

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why Route Groups Failed
The issue appears to be a fundamental incompatibility between:
1. **Next.js 15 + App Router** - Newer version with potential bugs
2. **Turbopack** - Experimental bundler with known issues
3. **Windows file system** - Path handling differences
4. **Multiple Node.js projects** in same repository (the `old/` folder)

### Key Indicators It Was Never Working
- Session 2 logs: "Module resolution issue with @supabase/ssr in middleware"
- Session 3 logs: "Attempted to fix...route groups remained non-functional"
- No evidence in any logs of route groups ever returning 200 status

## 📚 LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Route Groups Are Not Always Reliable
- In Next.js 15 with certain configurations, route groups may not work
- Regular folder structure is more reliable
- Test route groups early in project setup

### 2. Multiple Lockfiles Cause Issues
- Keep only one lockfile per project
- Remove lockfiles from parent/child directories
- The `old/` folder interference was real but not the root cause

### 3. Missing Dependencies Give Misleading Errors
- The 500 error on `/login` was due to missing `zod` and `@radix-ui/react-label`
- Always check server logs for actual error messages
- Module not found errors can manifest as 500s

### 4. Tailwind CSS Utility Classes
- `border-border` is not a valid Tailwind class
- Use `border` for the border property
- Custom colors are applied differently than utilities

## 🛠️ QUICK FIX REFERENCE

If you encounter this issue again, here's the quick fix:

```bash
# 1. Move pages out of route groups
cd app
mv "app/(auth)/*" app/
mv "app/(platform)/*" app/
rmdir "app/(auth)" "app/(platform)"

# 2. Update middleware.ts
# Change: '/auth/login' → '/login'
# Change: path.startsWith('/auth/') → path === '/login'

# 3. Clear cache and restart
rm -rf .next
PORT=3001 npm run dev

# 4. Install any missing dependencies shown in console
npm install [missing-packages]
```
