## Session 2 Summary
**Date:** September 28, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase Progress:** Phase 1 - Foundation (100% complete) ‚úÖ | Phase 2 - Core Application Interface (35% complete) üöß

### ‚úÖ Completed
- **Authentication System (Phase 1)**
  - Created middleware for route protection (`app/middleware.ts`)
  - Built auth helper utilities with Supabase integration (`lib/auth/auth-helpers.ts`)
  - Implemented RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) (`lib/auth/rbac.ts`)
  - Created auth constants and permissions (`lib/auth/constants.ts`)
  - Built login page with API route (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`, `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`)
  - Created auth layout (`app/(auth)/layout.tsx`)

- **Dashboard Layout & Navigation (Phase 1)**
  - Built platform layout wrapper (`app/(platform)/layout.tsx`)
  - Created dashboard shell component (`components/layouts/dashboard-shell.tsx`)
  - Implemented main sidebar with role-based navigation (`components/layouts/sidebar/main-sidebar.tsx`)
  - Added topbar with user menu and notifications (`components/layouts/topbar/topbar.tsx`)

- **Protected Route Pages (Phase 2 Started)**
  - Dashboard page with widgets and real-time stats (`app/(platform)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
  - CRM page with customer management table (`app/(platform)/crm/page.tsx`)
  - Projects page with project cards and progress tracking (`app/(platform)/projects/page.tsx`)
  - Settings page with multiple tabs (profile, org, billing, security) (`app/(platform)/settings/page.tsx`)

- **Additional Components**
  - Created icons component (`components/ui/icons.tsx`)
  - Installed missing shadcn/ui components (dropdown-menu, progress)

### üöß In Progress
- Authentication flow testing (needs real Supabase users created)
- Connecting frontend to actual database data (currently using mock data)

### ‚ùå Blocked/Deferred
- Module resolution issue with @supabase/ssr in middleware (package is installed but Turbopack can't resolve it)
- Some TypeScript errors in legacy components from old site

### üìù Key Decisions
- Used Supabase SSR for authentication instead of custom JWT implementation
- Implemented file-based role routing with route groups: `(auth)`, `(platform)`
- Created comprehensive RBAC system with granular permissions
- Built all major protected pages upfront with mock data
- Used Server Components by default (following Next.js 15 best practices)

### üìÅ Files Modified
**Created:**
- `app/middleware.ts`
- `app/lib/auth/auth-helpers.ts`
- `app/lib/auth/rbac.ts`
- `app/lib/auth/constants.ts`
- `app/app/(auth)/layout.tsx`
- `app/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- `app/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- `app/app/(platform)/layout.tsx`
- `app/app/(platform)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `app/app/(platform)/crm/page.tsx`
- `app/app/(platform)/projects/page.tsx`
- `app/app/(platform)/settings/page.tsx`
- `app/components/layouts/dashboard-shell.tsx`
- `app/components/layouts/sidebar/main-sidebar.tsx`
- `app/components/layouts/topbar/topbar.tsx`
- `app/components/ui/icons.tsx`
- `app/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` (via shadcn)
- `app/components/ui/progress.tsx` (via shadcn)

**Modified:**
- `app/lib/supabase-server.ts` (updated for Next.js 15 cookies)
- `APP_BUILD_PLAN.md` (marked Phase 1 complete)

### üêõ Known Issues
1. **Middleware Module Resolution**: @supabase/ssr not resolving in Turbopack
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Some legacy components have type issues
3. **Cookies Async**: Next.js 15 requires await for cookies() function
4. **Mock Data**: All pages currently use hardcoded data

### üí≠ Notes for Next Session
- Create test users in Supabase Auth dashboard
- Fix the middleware module resolution issue
- Connect dashboard widgets to real database queries
- Implement organization creation flow
- Add team member invitation system
- Test the complete authentication flow end-to-end
- Consider implementing proper error boundaries
- Add loading states for data fetching
- Implement actual sign-out functionality

### üéØ Phase 2 Priorities (Next Session)
1. **Backend Integration**:
   - Connect dashboard to real data
   - Implement user profile updates
   - Create organization CRUD operations

2. **Team Management**:
   - Organization creation flow
   - Team member invitations
   - Role assignment UI

3. **Real-time Features**:
   - Activity feed with database triggers
   - Notification system backend

### ‚úÖ Quality Checks
- [x] APP_BUILD_PLAN.md updated with progress
- [ ] TypeScript has zero errors (some legacy component issues remain)
- [ ] ESLint passing (minor warnings for unused imports)
- [ ] Tests passing (no tests written yet)
- [x] No exposed secrets or keys
- [x] File size limits respected (<200 lines for components)
