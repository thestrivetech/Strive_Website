# Session 1 Summary - SaaS Platform Architecture & Setup

**Date:** September 28, 2024
**Goal:** Determine Next.js migration strategy and initialize SaaS platform

---

## 🎯 Key Decision: Incremental Migration Strategy

### Initial Question
Should we start from scratch or incrementally migrate the existing React/Vite marketing site to Next.js?

### Decision Made
**Hybrid Approach:** Keep marketing site separate, build new SaaS platform fresh
- Marketing site (strivetech.ai) - Keep React/Vite with minor tweaks
- SaaS platform (app.strivetech.ai) - Fresh Next.js 15 build

### Rationale
- Zero risk to production marketing site
- Can develop SaaS independently
- Reuse UI components (56 shadcn components)
- Connect when app is production-ready

---

## 🏗️ What Was Built

### 1. Next.js 15 Application (`app/` directory)
```bash
✅ Next.js 15 with App Router
✅ TypeScript configured
✅ Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
✅ ESLint enabled
✅ 56 UI components copied from old/client/src/components/ui/
✅ Hooks and utilities migrated
```

### 2. Database Schema (Prisma)
**13 Core Models Created:**
- **Users & Auth:** User, Organization, OrganizationMember
- **CRM:** Customer (with LEAD/PROSPECT/ACTIVE/CHURNED status)
- **Projects:** Project, Task
- **AI:** AIConversation, AITool
- **Billing:** Subscription, UsageTracking
- **Calendar:** Appointment
- **Content:** Content
- **Audit:** ActivityLog

### 3. Documentation Created

#### APP_BUILD_PLAN.md
- 10-week implementation roadmap
- Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 2: Core Application Interface (Weeks 3-4)
- Phase 3: SaaS Features (Weeks 5-8)
- Phase 4: Integration (Weeks 9-10)

#### feature-&-tool-marketplace.md
- 21 target industries defined
- 27 tools/solutions from marketing site catalogued
- 3-tier subscription matrix:
  - **Tier 1** ($299-$499): 3 tools, 5 projects, basic features
  - **Tier 2** ($699-$1K): 10 tools, unlimited projects, industry dashboards
  - **Tier 3** (Enterprise): Unlimited tools, custom workflows, white-label

## 🔧 Architecture Decisions

### Authentication Strategy
- **Marketing site:** Maintains auth (Passport.js)
- **SaaS platform:** Validates JWT from marketing site
- **Cookie sharing:** Domain set to `.strivetech.ai`
- **User flow:** Login on main site → redirect to app.strivetech.ai

### Database Strategy
- **Two separate Supabase databases:**
  - Marketing DB: Existing (contact forms, newsletter, basic users)
  - SaaS DB: New (full platform features)
- **User sync:** Create records in both DBs on signup

### Tech Stack Confirmed
```typescript
// SaaS Platform (app/)
{
  framework: "Next.js 15 (App Router)",
  database: "Prisma + Supabase",
  auth: "JWT validation from marketing",
  ai: "OpenRouter + Groq APIs",
  payments: "Stripe",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui",
  state: "TanStack Query + Zustand (if needed)"
}
```

## 📋 CLAUDE.md Assessment

### Issues Identified & Fixed
1. ✅ Path alias clarification (`@/*` → app root)
2. ✅ Feature module structure refined
3. ✅ Database table list updated to match Prisma schema
4. ✅ Server Components vs Client Components guidelines added
5. ✅ RBAC implementation details specified
6. ✅ Testing examples provided
7. ✅ Security best practices expanded
8. ✅ Error handling standards added

### Final CLAUDE.md Status
- Reduced from 515 lines → 216 lines (concise version)
- Full documentation moved to README.md
- Optimized as session memory for consistent development

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Session 2+)

### Immediate Priority
1. Setup new Supabase database
2. Configure environment variables
3. Run Prisma migrations
4. Implement auth middleware

### Phase 2 Goals
- Build authenticated dashboard shell
- Create organization/workspace structure
- Implement base navigation
- Setup RBAC middleware

### Key Files to Reference
- `app/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- `APP_BUILD_PLAN.md` - Implementation roadmap
- `feature-&-tool-marketplace.md` - Tier features matrix
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development rules & patterns

---

## 💡 Important Context

### What's Working
- Marketing site remains untouched and functional
- Clear separation of concerns (marketing vs SaaS)
- Comprehensive documentation for future sessions
- Modular architecture ready for implementation

### Lessons Learned
- Don't rebuild what's working (marketing site)
- Separate databases prevent coupling
- Feature-first organization scales better
- Start with core, add advanced features later

**Session 1 Status:** ✅ Foundation Complete - Ready for Phase 2 Implementation
