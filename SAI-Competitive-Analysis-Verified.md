# SAI COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS - VERIFIED DATA
**Date:** November 26, 2025  
**Research Methodology:** Comprehensive web search verification of all platforms

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After thorough verification, here are the key findings:

### ✅ HIGHWAY.AI IS NOT A DIRECT COMPETITOR
**Highway.ai is primarily a mortgage professional tool, NOT an all-in-one real estate agent platform like SAI.**

**What Highway.ai Actually Offers:**
- Market insights and economic forecasts (MBS Highway)
- Automated marketing for mortgage professionals (ListReports)
- Agent production database for loan originators
- Co-branded marketing materials
- Home valuation reports

**What Highway.ai Does NOT Offer:**
- ❌ Comprehensive CRM for agents
- ❌ Transaction management
- ❌ Expense tracking
- ❌ AI command center for agents
- ❌ Agent-focused productivity tools

**Target Audience:** Primarily mortgage loan originators, with secondary tools for real estate agents (limited to marketing automation)

**Pricing:** Not publicly disclosed; requires sales contact

**Recommendation:** **REMOVE Highway.ai from the comparison table.** It is not a direct competitor to SAI. It's more similar to tools like Keeping Current Matters (KCM) - a marketing content provider, not an all-in-one platform.
