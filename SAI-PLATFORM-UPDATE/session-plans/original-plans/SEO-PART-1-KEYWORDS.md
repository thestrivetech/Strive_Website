## 7. Search Intent Analysis

### Commercial Intent Keywords (High Priority)
**Characteristics:** User is actively shopping, comparing, or ready to buy

**Keywords:**
- "best CRM for realtors" → Create comparison page, highlight SAI advantages
- "Follow Up Boss alternatives" → Create dedicated competitor comparison
- "real estate CRM pricing" → Direct to /pricing page
- "affordable CRM for real estate" → Emphasize $999/mo value

**Content Strategy:**
- Strong CTAs: "Start Free Trial", "See Pricing", "Compare Plans"
- Social proof: Testimonials, user counts, success metrics
- Comparison tables: SAI vs competitors
- Pricing transparency: Show exact costs, no "Contact Sales" gatekeeping

---

### Informational Intent Keywords (Medium Priority)
**Characteristics:** User is learning, researching, not yet ready to buy

**Keywords:**
- "how to manage real estate leads" → Blog post with actionable tips + soft CTA to SAI
- "real estate agent productivity tips" → Blog post, mention SAI as productivity tool
- "what is transaction management software" → Educational content + SAI product mention
- "AI in real estate 2025" → Trend analysis, position SAI as AI-native

**Content Strategy:**
- Educational blog posts (1,500-2,500 words)
- No aggressive CTAs (banner CTA at bottom: "Want to try SAI?" is sufficient)
- Focus on providing value first, build trust
- Internal linking to commercial pages (e.g., link "best CRM" to /platform)

---

### Navigational Intent Keywords (Low Priority for SEO)
**Characteristics:** User is searching for a specific brand or product

**Keywords:**
- "SAI Platform" → Already knows brand (good problem to have!)

- "Follow Up Boss" → Competitor brand search (can't rank, but can advertise)

**Content Strategy:**
- Ensure brand name ranks #1 for "SAI Platform" (should be automatic)
- Create "SAI vs [Competitor]" pages to capture competitor comparison searches
- Don't waste SEO effort on branded competitor searches

- Fast signup process (5 minutes or less)

---

  - "How to Calculate Cap Rate for Investment Properties" (3,200 searches)

  - "The True Cost of Real Estate Tool Fragmentation" (pain point content)

  - "Best CRM for Solo Real Estate Agents" (210 searches)
  - "Real Estate Software for Small Teams Under $1000" (140 searches)
  - "How Solo Agents Can Compete with Big Teams" (new)
