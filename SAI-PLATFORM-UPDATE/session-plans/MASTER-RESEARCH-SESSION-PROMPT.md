## CRITICAL MISSION

I need to completely verify and fix ALL percentage claims and statistics across the SAI Platform website. This website markets a real estate CRM platform, and currently contains many unverified, poorly sourced, or completely fabricated statistics that damage credibility.

**Your task:** Deploy multiple research agents IN PARALLEL to gather verified statistics from ONLY credible sources, then update all website files with accurate, properly cited information.

## PHASE 1: PARALLEL RESEARCH (Deploy 3 Agents Simultaneously)

You MUST launch these 3 research agents in a SINGLE message with multiple Task tool calls:

```

## PHASE 2: COMPILE RESEARCH

After all 3 agents complete, read their outputs and create:

**File: `/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/SAI-PLATFORM-UPDATE/research/VERIFIED-STATISTICS-MASTER.md`**

Structure:
```markdown
# Verified Statistics for SAI Platform Website

## Source Quality Tiers
- **Tier 1 (Highest):** NAR, BLS, Gartner, McKinsey, Forrester
- **Tier 2 (High):** HubSpot Research, Salesforce Research, HBR
- **Tier 3 (Acceptable):** Industry reports from reputable firms

## Real Estate Industry Statistics
[Compiled from Agent 1]

## AI & Automation Statistics
[Compiled from Agent 2]

## CRM & SaaS Benchmarks
[Compiled from Agent 3]

## Statistics NOT Found (Need Alternative Language)
[List claims we couldn't verify - these need qualitative replacement]
```

## PHASE 3: SAI PLATFORM CAPABILITIES AUDIT

Read these files to understand what SAI Platform ACTUALLY does:
- `/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/SAI-PLATFORM-UPDATE/SAI-PLATFORM-OVERVIEW.md`
- `/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/SAI-PLATFORM-UPDATE/SAI-DEMO-SCRIPT.md`
- `/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/SAI-PLATFORM-UPDATE/SAI-PITCH-DECK-CONTEXT.md`
- `/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/SAI-PLATFORM-UPDATE/COMING-TO-SAI.md`

Create:
**File: `/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/SAI-PLATFORM-UPDATE/research/SAI-CLAIMS-WE-CAN-MAKE.md`**

Categorize all SAI features as:
1. **LIVE & PROVEN** - Can make specific claims
2. **LIVE & UNPROVEN** - Feature exists but no performance data
3. **COMING SOON** - In roadmap, must note "coming soon"
4. **ASPIRATIONAL** - Don't claim at all

## PHASE 4: UPDATE ALL WEBSITE FILES

Using ONLY verified statistics from Phase 2 and approved claims from Phase 3:

### Files to Update (in order):

1. **`/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/client/src/data/sai/modules.ts`**
   - Update all `painPoint` fields with verified industry stats
   - Update all `solution` fields - remove unverifiable claims
   - Update all `sourceUrl` fields with actual source URLs
   - Change specific percentages to verified numbers OR qualitative language

2. **`/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/client/src/data/sai/market-stats.ts`**
   - Replace all statistics with verified sources
   - Add source property to each stat

3. **`/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/client/src/data/ai-insights-comparison.ts`**
   - Update improvement claims
   - Ensure time comparisons are realistic
   - Use verified statistics only

4. **`/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/client/src/data/sai/use-cases.ts`**
   - Remove specific unverified performance claims
   - Use qualitative language for SAI benefits

5. **`/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/client/src/data/resources/whitepapers/ethical-ai-implementation.ts`**
   - COMPLETE REWRITE required
   - Remove ALL fabricated case studies (MedPractice, Regional Bank, IndustrialTech)
   - Remove ALL made-up statistics (3.7x ROI, 90% adoption, etc.)
   - Rewrite as SAI Platform whitepaper with verified stats only

6. **`/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/client/src/data/resources/blog-posts/automation-roi.ts`**
   - Update with verified statistics

7. **`/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/client/src/data/resources/blog-posts/ai-success-stories-business-transformation.ts`**
   - Remove unverifiable claims
   - Note: This may need significant revision or removal

8. **`/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/client/src/data/sai/competitors.ts`**
   - Verify AI accuracy claims or make qualitative

9. **`/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/client/src/data/sai/roadmap.ts`**
   - Verify any statistics or make qualitative

## RULES FOR ALL UPDATES

### Statistics Rules:
1. **Tier 1 Source Required** - Use only verified statistics from credible sources
2. **Citation Required** - Add source URL in comments or data structure
3. **Date Required** - Note publication year (prefer 2022-2025 data)
4. **No Fabrication** - If we can't find a stat, use qualitative language

### Language Alternatives (when no verified stat exists):
| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| "35% more deals" | "More deals closed" |
| "85% accuracy" | "High accuracy" |
| "50% time savings" | "Significant time savings" |
| "119% higher click-through" | "Higher engagement rates" |
| "3.7x ROI" | "Strong ROI" or remove entirely |

### SAI-Specific Claims:
- ONLY claim what SAI actually does (from capabilities audit)
- Mark roadmap features as "Coming Soon"
- Don't claim performance metrics we haven't measured

## PHASE 5: VERIFICATION

After all updates:

1. Run `npm run check` - TypeScript validation
2. Run `npm run build` - Build verification
3. Search for remaining issues:
   ```
   Grep for: \d+% in client/src/data
   ```
   Verify each remaining percentage has a source

4. Create final report:
**File: `/Users/grant/Desktop/Github/Strive_Website/SAI-PLATFORM-UPDATE/research/STATISTICS-REVISION-COMPLETE.md`**

Include:
- Summary of all changes made
- List of statistics now properly cited
- List of claims converted to qualitative language
- Any remaining items needing attention
