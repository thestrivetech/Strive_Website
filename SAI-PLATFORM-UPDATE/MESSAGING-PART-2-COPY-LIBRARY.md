## Feature Descriptions

### Module: CRM & Lead Management

**Short (1-line):**
- Manage unlimited contacts, score leads automatically, and never lose track of a buyer or seller.
- Unlimited contacts, smart scoring (HOT/WARM/COLD), pipeline tracking, and automated follow-ups.
- Track leads, prioritize hot prospects, and automate nurture campaigns—all in one CRM.

**Medium (2-3 lines):**
- SAI CRM gives you unlimited contacts (no per-contact fees), AI-powered lead scoring (HOT/WARM/COLD based on engagement), and visual pipeline tracking. Automated follow-ups ensure you never forget a lead, and team collaboration features make it easy to assign and manage contacts across your brokerage.
- Manage your entire database in one place. SAI tracks every email open, website visit, and form fill—then scores each lead so you know who's ready to buy. With automated drip campaigns and task reminders, you'll close 35% more deals without working more hours.

**Long (paragraph):**
- The SAI CRM is designed specifically for real estate agents, teams, and brokerages. Unlike generic CRMs that charge per contact or per user, SAI gives you unlimited contacts and unlimited users for one flat monthly price. Our AI-powered lead scoring analyzes engagement (email opens, website visits, form fills, call history) and automatically labels each contact as HOT, WARM, or COLD—so you always know who to prioritize. The visual pipeline (LEAD → QUALIFIED → NURTURE → CONVERTED) gives you an at-a-glance view of your entire funnel, and you can drag-and-drop deals between stages with ease. Automated follow-up campaigns (email, SMS, task reminders) run in the background, nurturing leads even when you're busy. For teams, SAI offers lead assignment (round-robin or manual), shared pipelines, and performance tracking so managers can see exactly who's working what. And because SAI is all-in-one, your CRM data auto-syncs with The Office (transactions), Content Studio (marketing), and Global SAI (your AI assistant)—no more manually copying data between tools. Over 5,000 agents use SAI CRM to close 35% more deals, save 6 hours/week on data entry, and never lose a lead again. Try it free for 14 days.

### Module: The Office (Transaction Management)

**Short (1-line):**
- Handle 6 deal types with auto-generated workflows, document management, and deadline tracking.
- Track buyers, sellers, rentals, and investment deals with deal-specific processes.
- From offer to closing, The Office auto-generates every task and deadline you need.

**Medium (2-3 lines):**
- The Office handles 6 deal types: HOME_BUYING, HOME_SELLING, RENTAL_LANDLORD, RENTAL_TENANT, INVESTMENT_PROPERTY, and FSBO. Each deal type auto-generates 8-15 processes (tasks, deadlines, documents) so you never miss a step. Upload contracts, track inspections, assign tasks to team members, and get automated reminders as closing approaches.
- Real estate transactions have a lot of moving parts. The Office makes it simple: choose your deal type, and SAI auto-generates a complete workflow with every task and deadline you need. Track documents, assign to-dos to your TC or team, and get email/SMS reminders so nothing slips through the cracks. Works for traditional sales, FSBOs, rentals, and complex investment deals.

**Long (paragraph):**
- The Office is SAI's transaction management module, purpose-built for real estate professionals who handle multiple deal types. Unlike generic CRMs that treat all transactions the same, The Office recognizes 6 distinct deal types—HOME_BUYING, HOME_SELLING, RENTAL_LANDLORD, RENTAL_TENANT, INVESTMENT_PROPERTY, and FSBO—and auto-generates 8-15 process steps for each based on industry best practices. For example, a HOME_BUYING deal might include: pre-approval, offer submission, inspection scheduling, appraisal, title search, walkthrough, and closing. Each step comes with tasks, deadlines, and document requirements. You can upload contracts, disclosures, inspection reports, and closing statements directly to the deal, keeping everything organized in one place. Task assignment makes it easy to delegate to transaction coordinators, assistants, or team members, and automated email/SMS reminders ensure no one misses a deadline. The Office also handles complex scenarios: 1031 exchanges, multi-family purchases, seller financing, and FSBO deals all have dedicated workflows. And because The Office is integrated with SAI CRM, every deal is automatically linked to the associated contacts—no manual data entry required.

**Template 1: All-in-One Value Prop**
```
I used to juggle 5+ tools to run my real estate business:
• CRM for leads
• Transaction manager for deals
• Email platform for campaigns
• Market data subscription
• AI tool for content

Total cost: $850/month. Total headache: Immeasurable.

Then I found SAI Platform.

One platform. Five tools. $999/month. Unlimited users.

I added my assistant for free (would've been $69/month on my old CRM).

I'm saving $7,200/year and my business runs smoother than ever.

If you're tired of switching tabs and paying per-user fees, check out SAI.

**Template 2: Time Savings Story**
```
Real talk: I used to spend Sundays doing admin.

Data entry. Email follow-ups. Social posts. Deal checklists.

20 hours/week of busywork that didn't make me money.

Since switching to SAI Platform, I've automated 75% of it:
✅ Email drips run automatically
✅ Deal workflows auto-generate
✅ Social posts schedule themselves
✅ Lead scoring shows me who's hot

I got 15 hours back per week. That's 720 hours/year.

I used that time to close 6 extra deals. Worth $60k.

Best ROI I've ever seen.

## Objection Handling

### Objection: "SAI is $999/month. I'm only paying $450 now."

**Response 1 (ROI Focus):**
"True, but let's look at what you're getting. You're paying $450 for CRM, email, and transactions. SAI is $999, but it also includes market data (save $300/month vs. CoStar) and AI (save $50/month). Plus, you can add unlimited users for free. If you have an assistant or team member, that's another $69/month saved. Total value: $1,400+. You're actually saving money."

**Response 2 (Time Value):**
"SAI saves you 15 hours/week by automating follow-ups, workflows, and data syncing. If your time is worth $100/hour, that's $1,500/week saved. The extra $549/month pays for itself in 2 days."

**Response 3 (Revenue Focus):**
"Fair concern. But agents using SAI close 35% more deals thanks to AI lead scoring and automated nurture. If you close 12 deals/year now, that's 4 extra deals. At $10k commission each, that's $40,000 extra revenue. The $549/month difference is a rounding error."

---

### Objection: "I'm a solo agent. I don't need unlimited users."

**Response:**
"Totally get it. Even as a solo agent, you might add an assistant or TC later. When you do, they're free on SAI. On Follow Up Boss, that's $69/month extra. Plus, SAI includes transaction management, market data, and AI—features you'd pay separately for elsewhere. So even solo, you're getting more value."

---

### Objection: "I'm locked into a contract with [Current CRM]."

**Response:**
"We hear this a lot. Here's what most agents do: start your SAI trial now (14 days free, no credit card). Import your contacts and test the platform. When your current contract ends, you'll be ready to switch immediately—no learning curve. And if you love SAI before your contract ends, many agents find the ROI justifies paying both temporarily."
