### Battle Card: SAI vs. Follow Up Boss

**COMPETITOR OVERVIEW**
- **Founded:** 2011 | **Customers:** 25,000+ agents
- **Pricing:** $69/user/month | **Target:** Solo agents, small teams
- **Strengths:** Clean UI, reliable CRM, strong automation
- **Weaknesses:** CRM-only (no transactions, no marketing, no market data)

**SAI'S KEY ADVANTAGES**
1. **All-in-One Platform** → FUB is CRM-only; SAI includes 5 modules
2. **Flat Pricing** → $999/mo unlimited users vs. $69/user (break-even: 15 agents)
3. **Transaction Management** → SAI has 6 deal types with checklists; FUB has none
4. **AI Content Generation** → SAI has 13+ types; FUB has none
5. **Market Intelligence** → SAI has REID module; FUB has no market data

**WHEN SAI WINS**
- Team of 2+ agents (flat pricing saves money)
- Need transaction management (deals, checklists, docs)
- Want all-in-one consolidation (tired of 5+ tools)
- Need AI content (listing descriptions, social posts, emails)
- Investor-focused agents (REID's ROI calculators)

**WHEN FOLLOW UP BOSS WINS**
- Solo agent on tight budget ($69 vs. $999)
- Only need CRM (happy with separate tools for transactions, etc.)
- Need Zapier today (SAI is Q2 2025)

**DISCOVERY QUESTIONS**
- "How many agents are on your team?" (2+ → SAI wins on pricing)
- "How do you manage deals today?" (Spreadsheets/Dotloop → SAI wins)
- "How do you create listing descriptions and social posts?" (Manually → SAI's AI)
- "What tools do you pay for each month?" (5+ → SAI consolidation)

**DEMO FOCUS**
- Show The Office (transaction management) → FUB doesn't have
- Demo Content Studio (AI listing description) → FUB doesn't have
- Show REID (market data, ROI calculator) → FUB doesn't have
- Emphasize: "One platform. One login. All your data synced."

**OBJECTION HANDLING**
- **"FUB is only $69/month"** → "True, but you also need Dotloop ($49), Canva ($13), Buffer ($29), and CoStar ($150) = $310 total. SAI is $999 for your whole team with everything included."
- **"We've used FUB for 5 years"** → "FUB is great at CRM. The question is: are you tired of juggling 5 different logins? SAI lets you consolidate."

**PRICING COMPARISON (3-AGENT TEAM)**
- Follow Up Boss: $207/mo (CRM only)
- + Dotloop: $49/mo
- + Jasper: $49/mo
- + Mailchimp: $29/mo
- + Buffer: $29/mo
- + CoStar: $150/mo
- **Total: $513/mo = $6,156/year**
- **SAI: $999/mo = $11,988/year for unlimited users**
- Note: For 2+ agents needing all 5 tools, SAI wins on TCO

**CLOSING STATEMENT**
"Follow Up Boss is a great CRM. But if you're paying for 5 separate tools and logging into 5 different systems every day, SAI gives you everything in one platform—CRM, transactions, AI content, market data—at a flat rate for your entire team."

### Battle Card: SAI vs. BoomTown

**COMPETITOR OVERVIEW**
- **Founded:** 2006 | **Customers:** 100,000+ agents (enterprise)
- **Pricing:** $1,000-2,500/month (team plans) | **Target:** Large teams, brokerages
- **Strengths:** Lead generation included, IDX website, team management
- **Weaknesses:** Expensive, 12-24 month contracts, steep learning curve

**SAI'S KEY ADVANTAGES**
1. **Lower Cost** → $999/mo vs. $1,000-2,500/mo
2. **Month-to-Month** → SAI is flexible; BoomTown has 12-24 month contracts
3. **AI Content Generation** → SAI has 13+ types; BoomTown has none
4. **Investment Analysis** → SAI's REID has ROI calculators; BoomTown doesn't
5. **Faster Onboarding** → SAI: 1 hour vs. BoomTown: 2-4 weeks

**WHEN SAI WINS**
- Don't need lead gen included (handle your own ads or get referrals)
- Want lower cost ($999 vs. $1,000-2,500)
- Need AI content creation (BoomTown has no AI)
- Want month-to-month flexibility (no 12-month contract)
- Small to mid-size team (1-20 agents)

**WHEN BOOMTOWN WINS**
- Need lead generation included (IDX website, Facebook/Google ads)
- Large team with advanced team management needs (20+ agents)
- Want agent leaderboards and performance tracking (built-in)

**DISCOVERY QUESTIONS**
- "Where do most of your leads come from?" (Referrals/sphere → don't need BoomTown lead gen)
- "What's your monthly ad spend budget?" ($0-500 → BoomTown won't work well)
- "How important is flexibility?" (Want month-to-month → SAI wins)
- "Do you create a lot of marketing content?" (Yes → SAI's AI)

**DEMO FOCUS**
- Show Content Studio AI (listing descriptions in 30 seconds) → BoomTown can't do
- Show REID (ROI calculator for investment properties) → BoomTown can't do
- Show pricing: $999 flat vs. BoomTown $1,500+ with contract
- Emphasize: "AI-native platform, not legacy software with AI bolted on"

**OBJECTION HANDLING**
- **"BoomTown includes lead gen"** → "True, but you still pay for ad spend ($500-2,000/mo). With SAI, you run your own ads and save $501-1,001/month on software. Plus, our AI content often converts better than BoomTown's templates."
- **"BoomTown has IDX website"** → "We're launching website builder Q4 2025. Meanwhile, you can use Agent Image or Placester ($50/mo) and still save $451/mo vs. BoomTown."

**PRICING COMPARISON (15-AGENT TEAM)**
- BoomTown: $1,500/mo = $18,000/year
- SAI: $999/mo = $11,988/year
- **Savings: $6,012/year**

**CLOSING STATEMENT**
"BoomTown is powerful, but it's expensive and requires a long contract. SAI gives you CRM, transactions, AI content, and market data at $999/month with no contract—and you keep the $6,000+/year savings."

- "Are you planning to grow your team?" (Yes → SAI's flat pricing)

**DEMO FOCUS**
- Show Content Studio (13+ AI content types) → LionDesk can't do
- Show The Office (transaction management) → LionDesk can't do
- Show REID (market data) → LionDesk can't do

**OBJECTION HANDLING**

- LionDesk: $50/mo (CRM only)
- + Other tools: $248/mo
- **Total: $298/mo**

**CLOSING STATEMENT**
"LionDesk is affordable, but it's CRM-only. If you need AI content, transaction management, or market data—or if you're growing a team—SAI's $999 flat rate for unlimited users is a better long-term investment."

3. Recreate workflows (Salesforce Flow → SAI Automation)

**Challenge:** Salesforce workflows are complex. Expect 20-40 hours to rebuild.

**STEP 5: RETRAIN TEAM**

**Salesforce users are used to complexity.**

SAI is simpler:
- 1-hour onboarding
- Emphasize: "Built for real estate, not generic sales"

**TOTAL TIMELINE:** 6-12 weeks (complex migration)

---

### Migration Guide: kvCORE → SAI

**OVERVIEW**
- **Difficulty:** Hard (4/5)
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
- **Data Loss Risk:** Medium (IDX website rebuild)
- **Cost:** $0-2,000 (website rebuild)

**Similar to BoomTown migration (see above)**

**Key Differences:**
- kvCORE's behavioral automation is advanced (SAI's is Q3 2025)
- kvCORE's mobile app is strong (SAI's is Q2 2025)
- Plan interim solution (web app until SAI mobile launches)

---

### Migration Guide: Wise Agent → SAI

**OVERVIEW**
- **Difficulty:** Easy (1/5)
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
- **Data Loss Risk:** Very Low
- **Cost:** $0

**STEP 1: EXPORT DATA FROM WISE AGENT**

**Contacts:**
1. Log in to Wise Agent
2. Go to Contacts → Export
3. Download CSV

**STEP 2: IMPORT TO SAI**

- Same process as Follow Up Boss (see above)

**STEP 3: TRAIN TEAM**

- 1-hour onboarding
- Wise Agent users will love SAI's advanced features (AI, market data)

**TOTAL TIMELINE:** 1 week

## Objection Handling

Common objections and scripted responses.

---

### OBJECTION 1: "SAI is more expensive than [Competitor]"

**Variations:**
- "Follow Up Boss is only $69/month. SAI is $999. That's 14x more!"
- "LionDesk is $50/month. Why would I pay $999?"
- "Wise Agent is $39/month. SAI is way too expensive."

**RESPONSE (TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP):**

"I hear you—$999 looks higher than $69. But let me show you the full picture.

Follow Up Boss is CRM-only. Most agents also pay for:
- **Transaction management** (Dotloop): $49/month
- **Content creation** (Jasper): $49/month
- **Email marketing** (Mailchimp): $29/month
- **Social media** (Buffer): $29/month
- **Market data** (CoStar): $150/month

That's **$375/month** on top of Follow Up Boss = **$444/month per agent**.

For a team of 3 agents:
- Follow Up Boss + 5 tools = $207 + $1,125 = **$1,332/month**
- SAI Platform = **$999/month** for unlimited users with all 5 tools included

You'd **save $333/month** ($3,996/year) with SAI.

Plus, SAI gives you unlimited users. With Follow Up Boss, adding a 4th agent costs another $69/month. With SAI, it's $0.

So the real question isn't 'Is SAI more expensive?' It's 'Are you paying for 5 separate tools and ready to consolidate?'"

---

### OBJECTION 2: "I'm happy with my current CRM"

**Variations:**
- "Follow Up Boss works great for me. Why switch?"
- "We've been using Salesforce for 5 years. It does everything we need."

**RESPONSE (CONSOLIDATION PAIN):**

"That's great that [Current CRM] is working for you! I'm curious—how do you handle:

- **Transaction management?** (If they say Dotloop/SkySlope → "So you log into 2 systems?")
- **Content creation?** (If they say Canva/manual → "How long does it take to write a listing description?")
- **Market data?** (If they say CoStar/manual → "How much are you paying for market data?")

Here's what I hear from most agents who love their CRM: The CRM works, but they're juggling 5-6 different logins every day. SAI brings it all together.

Imagine starting your day, logging in once, and having:
- Your leads (CRM)
- Your deals with auto-generated checklists (The Office)
- AI-written listing descriptions (Content Studio)
- Market data for client questions (REID)
- An AI assistant to help you (Global SAI)

All synced. One platform. One login.

That's the difference. [Current CRM] is great at CRM. SAI is great at running your entire business."

---

### OBJECTION 3: "Too many features—I'll get overwhelmed"

**Variations:**
- "I just need simple CRM. SAI has too much."
- "5 modules sounds complicated."

**RESPONSE (MODULAR ADOPTION):**

"I totally get that. Here's the good news: you don't have to use all 5 modules on Day 1.

Most agents start with just the **CRM** (contacts, lead scoring, follow-ups). That's it. Just like Follow Up Boss.

Then, when you're comfortable, you add:
- **Week 2:** The Office (transaction management)
- **Week 3:** Content Studio (AI content)
- **Month 2:** REID (market data)
- **Month 3:** Global SAI (AI assistant)

You adopt at your own pace.

Plus, our 1-hour onboarding walks you through the basics. You'll be up and running in under an hour, using just the features you need. The rest is there when you're ready.

Think of SAI like a smartphone. It has 100 features, but you start with calls and texts. Over time, you discover maps, camera, apps. Same with SAI—start simple, grow into it."

---

### OBJECTION 4: "What if SAI goes out of business?"

**Variations:**
- "You're a new company. How do I know you'll be around in 5 years?"
- "What happens to my data if you shut down?"

**RESPONSE (TRACTION + DATA PORTABILITY):**

"Great question—you're being smart to think long-term. Here's what we've built so far:

- **5,000+ agents** using SAI Platform
- **50,000+ deals** closed on the platform
- **$2.5M+ in total savings** for our customers
- **4.8/5 rating** from 312 reviews
- **Backed by investors** who believe in our mission
- **Growing 40% quarter-over-quarter** (we're not going anywhere)

That said, your concern is valid. Here's our data guarantee:

1. **You own your data.** We never lock you in.
2. **Export anytime.** One-click export to CSV (contacts, deals, notes).
3. **If we ever shut down** (which we won't), we'll give you 90 days' notice and full data export assistance.
4. **No long-term contracts.** Month-to-month means you can leave anytime if we're not delivering.

Compare that to a 12-month contract with BoomTown or kvCORE. With SAI, you're never trapped.

We're building SAI for the long haul. But if anything ever changes, your data comes with you."

---

### OBJECTION 5: "I don't trust AI. It makes mistakes."

**Variations:**
- "AI will replace agents. I don't want to use it."
- "AI-generated content sounds robotic and fake."

**RESPONSE (AI AS ASSISTANT, NOT REPLACEMENT):**

"I hear you—and you're right to be cautious. Here's our philosophy:

**AI is an assistant, not a replacement.**

SAI's AI doesn't write a listing description and auto-post it. Instead:

1. **You provide inputs** (address, bedrooms, unique features)
2. **AI generates a draft** (30 seconds)
3. **You review and edit** (add your personal touch)
4. **You approve and publish**

You're always in control. AI saves you 15 minutes per listing, but you make the final call.

Same with Global SAI (our AI assistant). It can:
- Answer questions ("What's the cap rate for this property?")
- Update your CRM ("Add this contact as HOT lead")
- Search deals ("Show me all deals closing this month")

But it doesn't make decisions for you. You do.

Think of AI like spell-check. It helps you write faster, but you're still the author.

And here's the thing: Your competitors are using AI (Jasper, ChatGPT, etc.). The question is—do you want to use 5 separate AI tools, or one integrated AI that knows your CRM, deals, and market data?

That's what Global SAI does. It's your AI, trained on your data, helping you work faster."

---

### OBJECTION 6: "I need [Feature X] that SAI doesn't have"

**Variations:**
- "I need Zapier today. SAI is Q2 2025."
- "I need a mobile app. SAI doesn't have one yet."
- "I need SMS texting. SAI is Q2 2025."

**RESPONSE (ROADMAP + WORKAROUNDS):**

"You're absolutely right—[Feature X] is on our roadmap for [Quarter]. Let me share our plan and a potential workaround.

**Zapier Example:**
'Zapier is launching Q2 2025. We're in beta testing now with 50 users. Here's the interim workaround:

- Use SAI's API (launching Q2 2025 same time as Zapier)
- Or manually export/import CSV (one-click export to Google Sheets)
- Most teams find they don't need Zapier once everything is in one platform (CRM + deals + marketing + data)

But I hear you—if Zapier is a must-have today, SAI might not be ready for you yet. I'd recommend checking back in Q2 2025 when it launches.

That said, can I ask: What Zapier automations are you running today? (Listen—often SAI's built-in automation can replace Zapier.)'

**Mobile App Example:**
'Our mobile app launches Q2 2025. Meanwhile, SAI's web app is mobile-responsive. You can use it on your phone browser (just add to home screen for app-like experience).

Most agents find the web app works 90% as well as a native app. But if you're out in the field all day, you might want to wait for Q2 2025.

Or start with SAI on desktop (where most agents do 80% of their work), and add mobile when it launches in Q2.'

**General Approach:**
1. Acknowledge the gap
2. Share roadmap timeline
3. Offer workaround (if available)
4. Be honest if SAI isn't ready yet ('Check back in Q2')
5. Ask: 'Is this a blocker, or can you work around it for 3 months?'"

---

### OBJECTION 7: "I'm locked into a contract with [Competitor]"

**Variations:**
- "I have 8 months left on my BoomTown contract."
- "kvCORE has a 12-month contract. I can't switch until next year."

**RESPONSE (PLAN AHEAD + ROI):**

"Got it—contracts can be tough. Here's what I'd recommend:

**Option 1: Plan Your Transition**
'Let's plan your migration for [Contract End Date]. I can send you:
- Migration guide (step-by-step)
- Pricing quote (locked in for 90 days)
- Onboarding timeline

When your contract ends, you'll be ready to switch in 2 weeks. No last-minute scrambling.'

**Option 2: Calculate Early Termination ROI**
'Some teams decide to pay the early termination fee because SAI saves them money. Let's do the math:

- BoomTown early termination: $X (8 months × monthly fee)
- BoomTown remaining: $1,500/mo × 8 = $12,000
- SAI for 8 months: $999/mo × 8 = $7,992
- **Savings: $4,008**

If your early termination fee is less than $4,008, you'd still save money by switching now.

Want me to run the numbers for your situation?'

**Option 3: Start with SAI Free Tier**
'You can start using SAI's Free tier (100 contacts, 10 deals) while you finish your [Competitor] contract. Test it out risk-free. When your contract ends, upgrade to Elite.'

Most teams choose Option 1 (plan ahead). But if you're losing money with [Competitor], Option 2 makes sense."

---

### OBJECTION 8: "I need to talk to my team first"

**Variations:**
- "Let me discuss with my broker."
- "I need my team's buy-in before switching."

**RESPONSE (FACILITATE CONVERSATION):**

"Absolutely—this is a team decision. Here's how I can help:

**Option 1: Team Demo**
'Want to schedule a 30-minute team demo? I'll walk everyone through SAI, answer questions, and get everyone on the same page. When works for your team?'

**Option 2: Send Resources**
'I can send you:
- 5-minute product video (overview of 5 modules)
- Pricing one-pager (vs. current tools)
- Migration guide (what to expect)
- Case study (similar team to yours)

Share these with your team, and let's reconvene next week. Sound good?'

**Option 3: Free Trial**
'Your team can try SAI Free (100 contacts, 10 deals) risk-free. No credit card required. Run it parallel with your current CRM for 30 days and see if it clicks.'

What would be most helpful for your team?"

## When to Mention Competitors

Strategic guidance on competitive positioning in conversations.

---

### PROACTIVE COMPETITOR MENTIONS (When You Should Bring It Up)

**Situation 1: Prospect Says They're Evaluating Options**
- **Prospect:** "I'm looking at a few different CRMs."
- **You:** "Smart to compare. What are you looking at? (Listen) Great choices. Let me show you how SAI compares to [Competitor]."

**Situation 2: Prospect Asks "How Are You Different?"**
- **You:** "Great question. What are you currently using or considering? (Listen) Compared to [Competitor], SAI's key differences are..."

**Situation 3: Competitor Is Mentioned on Their Website/LinkedIn**
- **You:** "I saw you're using [Competitor]. How's that working for you? (Listen) Have you thought about consolidating with an all-in-one platform?"

---

### REACTIVE COMPETITOR MENTIONS (When They Bring It Up)

**Situation 1: "I'm Using [Competitor]"**
- **You:** "How long have you been using [Competitor]? What do you like about it? (Listen) What's missing? (Listen—pain points) Let me show you how SAI solves that."

**Situation 2: "I'm Comparing You to [Competitor]"**
- **You:** "Perfect. What's most important to you in making this decision? (Listen—priorities) Let me show you how SAI stacks up on those criteria."

---

### NEVER MENTION COMPETITORS (When to Stay Silent)

**Situation 1: Cold Outreach (Email, LinkedIn)**
- **Don't:** "Unlike Follow Up Boss, SAI has transaction management."
- **Do:** "SAI is an all-in-one real estate platform with CRM, transactions, AI content, and market data."

**Why:** Mentioning competitors in cold outreach:
1. Educates them about competitors they may not know
2. Sounds defensive
3. Dilutes your message

**Situation 2: Prospect Hasn't Mentioned Competitors**
- **Don't:** Proactively say "Have you looked at Follow Up Boss?"
- **Do:** Focus on SAI's value props and let them bring up competitors

**Situation 3: You're Winning the Deal**
- **Don't:** "And unlike BoomTown, we..."
- **Do:** Keep focusing on SAI's strengths

**Why:** Mentioning competitors when you're ahead can:
1. Introduce doubt
2. Make them reconsider
3. Slow down the deal

---

### HOW TO MENTION COMPETITORS (Tone & Approach)

**✅ DO:**
- Be respectful: "Follow Up Boss is a solid CRM. Many agents love it."
- Be factual: "BoomTown costs $1,500/month. SAI is $999."
- Be honest: "If you need an IDX website today, BoomTown might be better. SAI launches Q4 2025."
- Focus on fit: "SAI is built for teams 2-50. BoomTown targets larger teams."

**❌ DON'T:**
- Disparage: "BoomTown is terrible. Their software is outdated."
- Be emotional: "I can't believe anyone still uses Salesforce!"
- Exaggerate: "SAI is 10x better than Follow Up Boss." (Be specific)
- Trash talk: "kvCORE's support is awful." (Even if true, unprofessional)

**Golden Rule:** Praise competitors, differentiate SAI, let the prospect decide.

## Positioning Statements

One-liner competitive positioning statements for each competitor.

---

### SAI vs. Follow Up Boss

**1-Sentence Positioning:**
"Follow Up Boss is a great CRM for solo agents, but SAI is an all-in-one platform with CRM, transaction management, AI content, and market data at a flat rate for unlimited users."

**30-Second Pitch:**
"Follow Up Boss excels at CRM—lead management, automated follow-ups, clean UI. But it's CRM-only, so most agents also pay for Dotloop ($49/mo), Jasper ($49/mo), and CoStar ($150/mo). SAI gives you all 5 tools in one platform—CRM, transaction management, AI content, market data, and an AI assistant—at $999/month for unlimited users. For teams of 2+, SAI saves you $6,000+/year while eliminating the hassle of juggling 5 logins."

**When to Use:**
- Sales calls where prospect mentions Follow Up Boss
- Compare page (/compare/follow-up-boss)
- Demo intro: "Many of our customers switched from Follow Up Boss because..."

---

### SAI vs. BoomTown

**1-Sentence Positioning:**
"BoomTown is powerful for lead generation, but SAI is more affordable ($999 vs. $1,500+), month-to-month, and has AI content generation that BoomTown lacks."

**30-Second Pitch:**
"BoomTown is great if you need lead generation included—IDX website, Facebook ads, Google ads. But you're paying $1,500-2,500/month with a 12-month contract, plus ad spend. SAI is $999/month with no contract, and our AI content generation often outperforms BoomTown's templates. If you handle your own lead gen or get leads from referrals, SAI gives you everything else you need—CRM, transactions, AI content, market data—at a lower cost with more flexibility."

**When to Use:**
- Large teams evaluating enterprise solutions
- Agents frustrated with BoomTown's contracts
- Investor-focused agents (REID advantage)

---

### SAI vs. LionDesk

**1-Sentence Positioning:**
"LionDesk is affordable for solo agents, but SAI is an all-in-one platform with AI features and better value for growing teams."

**30-Second Pitch:**
"LionDesk is a solid, affordable CRM at $50/user. But it's CRM-only with no AI, no transaction management, and no market data. If you're a solo agent on a budget, LionDesk is great. But if you're growing a team or need AI content, SAI's $999 flat rate for unlimited users—with CRM, transactions, AI, and market data—is a better long-term investment."

**When to Use:**
- Solo agents considering growth
- Teams outgrowing LionDesk
- Agents looking for AI features

---

### SAI vs. Salesforce Real Estate Cloud

**1-Sentence Positioning:**
"Salesforce is built for Fortune 500 companies; SAI is built for real estate with features ready out-of-the-box at 1/10th the cost."

**30-Second Pitch:**
"Salesforce is incredibly powerful—highly customizable, robust integrations, enterprise-grade. But it's expensive ($150-300/user/month), requires a Salesforce admin, and needs $50,000+ implementation. SAI gives you real estate features out-of-the-box—6 deal types, MLS-ready content, ROI calculators—at $999/month for unlimited users with 1-hour onboarding. If you're a team under 50 agents, SAI is faster, simpler, and 10x more affordable."

**When to Use:**
- Mid-size teams evaluating Salesforce
- Teams frustrated with Salesforce complexity
- Brokerages without dedicated IT staff

---

### SAI vs. kvCORE

**1-Sentence Positioning:**
"kvCORE is strong on lead gen with IDX, but SAI is more affordable ($999 vs. $1,500) with AI features kvCORE lacks."

**30-Second Pitch:**
"kvCORE is a solid all-in-one platform with IDX website, lead gen, and behavioral automation. But it costs $1,500+/month with a 12-month contract. SAI is $999/month with no contract, and we have AI features kvCORE doesn't—AI content generation (13+ types), AI assistant (12+ models), and investment analysis (REID module). If you already have a website or don't need lead gen, SAI gives you more for less."

**When to Use:**
- Teams evaluating all-in-one platforms
- Agents who don't need IDX website
- Investor-focused agents (REID advantage)

---

### SAI vs. Wise Agent

**1-Sentence Positioning:**
"Wise Agent is perfect for solo agents on a budget; SAI is the professional-grade platform for agents serious about growing their business with AI and market intelligence."

**30-Second Pitch:**
"Wise Agent is incredibly affordable at $39/month, and it's a great starter CRM. But it has no AI, no market data, and basic features. If you're a new agent learning the business, Wise Agent is perfect. But if you need AI content, transaction management, market intelligence, or you're building a team, SAI's $999 flat rate for unlimited users is the investment you need to scale."

**When to Use:**
- Agents graduating from Wise Agent
- Teams looking for more advanced features
- Agents prioritizing growth over budget

## Selling Against Each Competitor

Tactical sales strategies for displacing each competitor.

---

### Selling Against Follow Up Boss

**DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:**
1. "How many agents are on your team?" (2+ → SAI wins on pricing)
2. "What do you use for transaction management?" (Dotloop/spreadsheets → SAI wins)
3. "How do you create listing descriptions and marketing content?" (Manually/Canva → SAI's AI)
4. "What's your total monthly software spend?" ($500+ → SAI consolidation)
5. "Do you work with investors?" (Yes → REID advantage)

**DEMO STRATEGY:**
1. **Start with CRM** (familiar to FUB users)
   - Show lead scoring (HOT/WARM/COLD)
   - Show automated follow-ups
   - Emphasize: "This part works just like Follow Up Boss"

2. **Show The Office** (transaction management)
   - Create a new HOME_BUYING deal
   - Show auto-generated 15-task checklist
   - Emphasize: "Follow Up Boss doesn't have this. Most agents use Dotloop separately."

3. **Demo Content Studio** (AI content)
   - Generate a listing description in 30 seconds
   - Show social media post generation
   - Emphasize: "Write a listing in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes"

4. **Show REID** (market data)
   - Search for investment property
   - Show ROI calculator (cap rate, cash flow)
   - Emphasize: "No need for CoStar ($150/mo)"

5. **End with pricing**
   - Show total cost comparison (FUB + 5 tools = $444/agent vs. SAI $999 unlimited)

**CLOSING QUESTIONS:**
- "If you could consolidate 5 tools into one platform and save $6,000/year, would that interest you?"
- "What's holding you back from trying SAI's free tier alongside Follow Up Boss?"

---

### Selling Against BoomTown

**DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:**
1. "Where do most of your leads come from?" (Referrals/sphere → don't need BoomTown lead gen)
2. "What's your monthly ad spend?" (<$1,000 → BoomTown ROI may be low)
3. "How many months left on your contract?" (Plan transition)
4. "What do you like about BoomTown?" (Listen—keep those features in SAI demo)
5. "What's frustrating about BoomTown?" (Cost, contract, complexity → SAI wins)

**DEMO STRATEGY:**
1. **Acknowledge BoomTown's strengths**
   - "BoomTown is great for lead gen. If that's your primary need, it might still be the best fit."

2. **Show AI content generation**
   - "BoomTown doesn't have this. Our AI-written ads often convert better than BoomTown's templates."

3. **Show REID**
   - "BoomTown has basic market reports. REID has investment-grade analysis."

4. **Show pricing**
   - "$999 vs. $1,500+ with no contract"

**CLOSING QUESTIONS:**
- "If you could save $6,000/year and get out of the 12-month contract, would that matter to you?"
- "Want to run SAI parallel with BoomTown for 30 days and compare?"

---

### Selling Against Salesforce

**DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:**
1. "Do you have a Salesforce admin on staff?" (No → SAI is easier)
2. "How long did implementation take?" (12 weeks+ → SAI is 1 hour)
3. "What did implementation cost?" ($50,000+ → SAI is $0)
4. "What do you use Salesforce for that's unique?" (If nothing RE-specific → SAI wins)

**DEMO STRATEGY:**
1. **Show real estate features out-of-box**
   - 6 deal types (pre-built, not custom objects)
   - MLS-ready content (not generic templates)
   - ROI calculators (built-in, not custom formulas)

2. **Emphasize speed**
   - "1-hour onboarding vs. 12-week implementation"

3. **Show pricing**
   - "$999 vs. $3,000/mo (20 agents)"

**CLOSING QUESTIONS:**
- "If you could get real estate features without a $50,000 implementation, would that change things?"

---

## Competitive FAQ

Common questions prospects ask about competitors.

---

### Q: "How is SAI different from Follow Up Boss?"

**A:** "Follow Up Boss is a CRM-only platform—great for lead management and automated follow-ups. SAI is an all-in-one platform with 5 modules:

1. **CRM** (like Follow Up Boss)
2. **Transaction Management** (Follow Up Boss doesn't have)
3. **AI Content Generation** (Follow Up Boss doesn't have)
4. **Market Intelligence** (Follow Up Boss doesn't have)
5. **AI Assistant** (Follow Up Boss doesn't have)

Follow Up Boss is $69/user. SAI is $999 for unlimited users.

If you only need CRM, Follow Up Boss is great. If you want to consolidate 5+ tools, SAI is better."

---

### Q: "Can I integrate SAI with Follow Up Boss?"

**A:** "Not directly. SAI is designed to replace Follow Up Boss (and 4 other tools). You'd migrate your contacts from Follow Up Boss to SAI (easy CSV import/export).

Why integrate when you can consolidate?"

---

### Q: "What does SAI offer that BoomTown doesn't?"

**A:** "Three big things:

1. **AI Content Generation** (13+ types: listing descriptions, social posts, emails, video scripts). BoomTown has templates, but not AI.
2. **Investment Analysis** (REID module with ROI calculator, cap rate, cash flow). BoomTown has basic market reports, not investor-grade analysis.
3. **Lower Cost + Flexibility** ($999/mo month-to-month vs. BoomTown $1,500+ with 12-month contract).

BoomTown's advantage is lead generation (IDX website, Facebook/Google ads). If you need that, BoomTown might be better. If you handle your own lead gen, SAI saves you $6,000+/year."

---

### Q: "Why is SAI cheaper than Salesforce?"

**A:** "Salesforce is a generic CRM built for every industry (retail, finance, healthcare, real estate). It requires customization ($50,000+ implementation) and a Salesforce admin ($80,000/year salary).

SAI is built specifically for real estate—6 deal types, MLS-ready content, ROI calculators—ready out-of-the-box. No implementation, no admin, no consultant.

That's why SAI is $999/month vs. Salesforce $3,000-15,000/month."

---

### Q: "Is SAI better than kvCORE?"

**A:** "Depends on what you need.

**kvCORE wins if you need:**
- IDX website included
- Behavioral automation today (SAI's is Q3 2025)
- Robust mobile app today (SAI's is Q2 2025)

**SAI wins if you:**
- Want lower cost ($999 vs. $1,500+)
- Don't need IDX website (have your own)
- Need AI content generation (kvCORE doesn't have)
- Need investment analysis (REID module)
- Want month-to-month flexibility (kvCORE has 12-month contracts)

Both are all-in-one platforms. The question is: Do you need kvCORE's lead gen, or SAI's AI?"

---

### Q: "Should I use SAI or Wise Agent if I'm a solo agent?"

**A:** "Honest answer: **Wise Agent** if you're on a tight budget and only need basic CRM.

**SAI** if you:
- Need AI content (Wise Agent has none)
- Need market intelligence (Wise Agent has none)
- Plan to grow a team (SAI's flat pricing scales better)
- Want professional-grade tools (Wise Agent is entry-level)

Wise Agent is $39/month. SAI is $999/month. That's a big difference for a solo agent.

But if you're doing $200k+ GCI and spending hours writing listing descriptions manually, SAI's AI content alone can save you 15 hours/week—worth the investment."

## Ethical Guidelines

How to compete ethically and professionally.

---

### THE GOLDEN RULE: NEVER DISPARAGE COMPETITORS

**❌ DON'T SAY:**
- "BoomTown's software is terrible."
- "Follow Up Boss is outdated."
- "Salesforce is a rip-off."
- "kvCORE's support is awful."

**✅ DO SAY:**
- "BoomTown is a strong platform, especially for lead generation."
- "Follow Up Boss is one of the most popular CRMs in real estate for good reason."
- "Salesforce is incredibly powerful for large enterprises."
- "kvCORE has a great mobile app."

**WHY:**
1. **Professionalism:** Trash-talking makes you look bad, not them.
2. **Credibility:** Prospects trust honest assessments, not sales pitches.
3. **Karma:** The real estate tech community is small. Don't burn bridges.

---

### BE FACTUAL, NOT EMOTIONAL

**❌ EMOTIONAL:**
- "I can't believe anyone still uses Salesforce!"
- "BoomTown is such a waste of money."

**✅ FACTUAL:**
- "Salesforce costs $150-300/user/month. SAI is $999 flat for unlimited users."
- "BoomTown is $1,500/month. SAI is $999. Both are all-in-one platforms."

**WHY:** Facts are persuasive. Emotion is off-putting.

---

### ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN COMPETITOR IS BETTER

**EXAMPLE:**
- "If you need an IDX website today, BoomTown or kvCORE are better choices. SAI's website builder launches Q4 2025. Check back then."
- "If you need Zapier today, Follow Up Boss has it. SAI launches Q2 2025."

**WHY:**
1. **Builds Trust:** Prospects appreciate honesty.
2. **Sets Expectations:** Better to disqualify early than overpromise.
3. **Long-Term Relationship:** They'll remember you were honest and come back.

---

### FOCUS ON SAI STRENGTHS, NOT COMPETITOR WEAKNESSES

**❌ WEAKNESS-FOCUSED:**
- "Follow Up Boss doesn't have transaction management. What a miss!"

**✅ STRENGTH-FOCUSED:**
- "SAI has transaction management with 6 deal types and auto-generated checklists. It's one of our most popular modules."

**WHY:** Positive messaging is more persuasive than negative.

---

### RESPECT COMPETITOR CUSTOMERS

**❌ INSULT CUSTOMERS:**
- "I can't believe you're paying $1,500 for BoomTown. That's crazy!"

**✅ EMPATHIZE:**
- "BoomTown is a strong platform. What made you choose it initially? (Listen) That makes sense. Here's how SAI might be a better fit now..."

**WHY:** You're not competing against the prospect. You're helping them make the best decision.

---

### WHEN IN DOUBT, TAKE THE HIGH ROAD

**Scenario:** Prospect says, "I heard SAI is buggy and support is slow."

**❌ WRONG RESPONSE:**
- "That's BS. Who told you that? Probably a BoomTown rep."

**✅ RIGHT RESPONSE:**
- "I appreciate you bringing that up. Can I ask where you heard that? (Listen) Here's our actual support data:
  - 4.8/5 rating from 312 reviews
  - 24-hour email response time (Elite tier)
  - 95% customer satisfaction score
  - We're in beta, so we're constantly improving. If you experience any issues, we fix them fast.

Want to try the free tier and see for yourself?"

**WHY:** Address concerns directly, provide evidence, stay professional.
