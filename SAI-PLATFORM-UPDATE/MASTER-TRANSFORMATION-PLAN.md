## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Transformation
Converting **Strive Tech** (AI consulting agency serving 21+ industries) into **SAI Platform** (all-in-one real estate SaaS for agents, teams, and brokerages).

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### About the Transformation

**Q: Why are we pivoting from AI consulting to real estate SaaS?**
A: SAI platform has been developed as the core product. The consulting business model doesn't match the SaaS product we've built. Real estate agents are our target market, and we need a site that speaks directly to them.

**Q: What happens to the AI consulting business?**
A: This transformation focuses the website entirely on SAI platform. If consulting services continue, they'd need a separate site or subdomain.

**Q: Will we lose SEO value?**
A: Some loss is inevitable, but we're mitigating with 301 redirects, maintaining URL structure where possible, and comprehensive internal linking. Long-term, real estate-focused content will rank better for our target keywords.

**Q: How long will the transformation take?**
A: Full transformation: 6-8 weeks. Homepage priority: 2-3 weeks. We can launch phases gradually.

### About Implementation

**Q: Can we do this in phases or must it be all at once?**
A: Recommended phased approach: Homepage → Core Pages → Content → Polish. This lets us see results faster and iterate.

**Q: What if we don't have real customer testimonials yet?**
A: Use success story templates based on beta results with appropriate disclaimers. Prioritize collecting real testimonials immediately after launch.

**Q: Do we need to create all content before launch?**
A: No. Launch with core pages (Homepage, Platform, Pricing) and 5-10 content pieces. Content creation is ongoing.

**Q: How do we handle the existing blog posts?**
A: Replace gradually. Redirect old posts to related new content. Create 10 real estate posts for launch, then 2-4 per month ongoing.

### About SAI Platform

**Q: What if features aren't built yet?**
A: Be transparent. Clearly mark "Coming Q1 2025" or "Coming 2026" on roadmap. Focus marketing on available features now.

**Q: How do we explain pricing?**
A: Three simple tiers: Free (trial), Elite ($999/mo), Custom (enterprise). Be transparent. Highlight unlimited users as differentiator.

**Q: What's our main competitive advantage?**
A: Four-fold: (1) All-in-one (vs. multiple tools), (2) Real estate-specialized (vs. generic CRM), (3) Unlimited users (vs. per-agent pricing), (4) AI-native (vs. AI bolted on).
