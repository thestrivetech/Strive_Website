| Transaction Mgmt | $49 | Dotloop |
| Content Creation | $49 | Jasper |

- SAI Platform: **$999/month**
- **Savings: $747/month ($8,964/year)**

**Conclusion:** SAI wins on TCO for teams 2+, even though per-user cost is higher for solo agents.

- Map fields (name, email, phone, tags, lead score)
- Duplicate detection runs automatically

**Step 3: Recreate Automated Workflows**
- SAI's automation builder supports similar triggers/actions
- Example: "New lead → Send welcome email → Wait 3 days → Follow-up call reminder"

**Step 4: Train Team on SAI Interface**

- Key differences: 5 modules vs. 1, AI assistant, deal pipelines

**Step 5: Run Parallel for 30 Days**

- Gradual transition to SAI as primary

**Estimated Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

---

### Objection Handling

**Objection:** "Follow Up Boss is only $69/month. SAI is $999. That's 14x more expensive!"

**Response:**
"You're right that Follow Up Boss is $69 per user. But it's CRM-only. Most agents also pay for:
- Transaction management ($49/mo)
- Email marketing ($29/mo)
- Content creation ($49/mo)
- Social scheduler ($29/mo)
- Market data ($150/mo)

That's $375/month in addition to Follow Up Boss = $444/month per agent.

For a team of 3, that's $1,332/month. SAI is $999/month for your entire team with all 5 tools included. You'd save $333/month ($3,996/year).

Plus, you get unlimited users. With Follow Up Boss, adding a 4th agent costs another $69/month. With SAI, it's $0."

**Objection:** "I've been using Follow Up Boss for 5 years. Why switch?"

**Response:**
"Follow Up Boss is great at what it does—lead management. The question is: are you still manually managing deals in spreadsheets or Dotloop? Creating listing descriptions in Google Docs? Scheduling social posts in Buffer?

If you're juggling 3-5 tools, SAI lets you consolidate everything. One login. One platform. All your data synced automatically.

You can export your Follow Up Boss contacts and import them to SAI in under an hour. We'll help you migrate."

---

### When SAI Wins

SAI Platform is the better choice when:

1. **You want lower cost**
   - $999/mo vs. $1,000-2,500/mo

2. **You don't need lead generation included**
   - You handle your own Facebook/Google ads or get leads from referrals

3. **You need AI content creation**
   - BoomTown has no AI content generation

4. **You need investment analysis tools**
   - SAI's REID module is purpose-built for investors

5. **You want month-to-month flexibility**
   - No 12-24 month contracts

6. **You have a small team (1-10 agents)**
   - BoomTown targets larger teams; may be overkill

7. **You want faster onboarding**
   - SAI: 1-hour onboarding vs. BoomTown: 2-4 weeks setup

---

### When BoomTown Wins

BoomTown is the better choice when:

1. **You need lead generation included**
   - IDX website, Facebook ads, Google ads all managed in-platform

2. **You're a large team or brokerage (20+ agents)**
   - BoomTown's team management features are more mature

3. **You want advanced team performance tracking**
   - Leaderboards, goals tracking, agent scorecards

4. **You have a dedicated marketing budget**
   - BoomTown's lead gen requires ad spend ($500-2,000/mo typical)

5. **You need an IDX website**
   - SAI doesn't include website builder (yet)

---

### Migration Path: BoomTown → SAI

**Challenges:**
- BoomTown data export is limited (contact support for full export)
- IDX website needs to be rebuilt elsewhere (recommend Agent Image or Placester)

**Step 1: Export Data**
- Contacts: Request full export from BoomTown support (CSV)
- Deals: Export pipeline data (limited fields)

**Step 2: Import to SAI**
- CRM Module → Import Contacts
- The Office → Manually recreate active deals (BoomTown export may be incomplete)

**Step 3: Replace IDX Website**
- Use 3rd-party IDX provider (Agent Image, Placester, Zillow Premier Agent)
- SAI's website builder is planned for Q4 2025

**Step 4: Set Up Your Own Lead Gen**
- Facebook ads → SAI landing pages (Q3 2025) or standalone landing page tool
- Google ads → Same approach

**Estimated Timeline:** 4-6 weeks (longer than Follow Up Boss due to website migration)

---

### Objection Handling

**Objection:** "BoomTown includes lead generation. SAI doesn't. How is SAI better?"

**Response:**
"You're right—BoomTown includes lead gen tools like IDX websites and ad management. But you're still paying for the ad spend itself ($500-2,000/month typical).

With SAI, you handle your own Facebook/Google ads (which you can do for the same cost), and you save $501-1,001/month on the software.

Plus, SAI's AI content generation helps you create better ads, landing pages, and follow-up emails—which often converts better than BoomTown's templates.

If you're already getting most of your leads from referrals, sphere, or your own marketing, you don't need to pay for BoomTown's lead gen features."

2. **You want faster setup**
   - SAI: 1-hour onboarding vs. Salesforce: 4-12 weeks (requires admin/consultant)

3. **You want real estate features out-of-the-box**
   - SAI's 6 deal types, MLS-ready content, ROI calculators are built-in
   - Salesforce requires custom configuration ($10,000-50,000 implementation)

4. **You want predictable, flat pricing**
   - SAI: $999/mo vs. Salesforce: $150-500/user + add-ons

5. **You need AI content generation**
   - SAI has 13+ content types built-in; Salesforce requires 3rd-party

6. **You need market intelligence**

7. **You don't have a Salesforce admin on staff**
   - SAI is user-friendly for non-technical agents

---

### When Salesforce Wins

Salesforce Real Estate Cloud is the better choice when:

1. **You're an enterprise brokerage (100+ agents)**
   - Salesforce scales better for very large teams

2. **You need highly customized workflows**
   - Salesforce's custom objects, Apex code, and Flow Builder are unmatched

   - Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud, Pardot, etc.

4. **You have a Salesforce admin or consultant on staff**
   - Required to configure and maintain the system

5. **You need granular role-based permissions**
   - Salesforce's permission sets are more advanced than SAI's basic roles

---

### Migration Path: Salesforce → SAI

**Challenges:**
- Salesforce data is highly customized; export may require admin help
- Custom workflows need to be rebuilt in SAI

**Step 1: Export Data**
- Use Salesforce Data Export (Setup → Data Export)
- Export Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities (deals)

**Step 2: Map Custom Fields**
- Identify which Salesforce custom fields map to SAI fields
- Create matching custom fields in SAI

**Step 3: Import to SAI**
- CRM → Import Contacts (CSV)
- The Office → Import Deals (CSV)

**Step 4: Rebuild Workflows**
- Salesforce Flow Builder → SAI Automation Builder
- Test all automations before going live

**SAI's Position:** Affordable all-in-one with AI-native features

### Win/Loss Patterns

**SAI Wins When:**
- Team size: 2+ agents (flat pricing advantage)
- Need: All-in-one consolidation
- Pain: Tool fragmentation, high costs
- Vertical: Investment-focused agents

**SAI Loses When:**
- Solo agent on tight budget ($39-69/mo competitors)
- Need: IDX website (BoomTown, kvCORE)
- Need: Lead generation included (BoomTown, kvCORE)
- Need: Zapier today (Q2 2025 for SAI)
- Enterprise: 100+ agents (Salesforce's advanced features)

### Recommended Positioning Statements

**vs. Follow Up Boss:**
"Follow Up Boss is a great CRM, but it's just a CRM. SAI gives you CRM + transaction management + AI content + market data in one platform, at a flat rate for your entire team."

**vs. BoomTown:**
"BoomTown costs $1,000-2,500/month and requires lead gen ad spend. SAI is $999/month all-in, with AI content generation that often outperforms BoomTown's templates."

**vs. LionDesk:**
"LionDesk is affordable at $50/user, but multiply that by your team size and add tools for transactions, marketing, and data—you're at $400+/month per agent. SAI is $999 flat for unlimited users."

**vs. Salesforce:**
"Salesforce is powerful but overkill for most real estate teams. SAI gives you real estate features out-of-the-box—6 deal types, MLS-ready content, ROI calculators—without a $50,000 implementation project."

**vs. kvCORE:**
"kvCORE costs $1,500+ with a 12-month contract. SAI is $999 month-to-month, with AI features kvCORE doesn't have (AI assistant, AI content generation, investment analysis)."

**vs. Wise Agent:**
"Wise Agent is great for solo agents on a budget. But if you need AI content, market data, or you're growing a team, SAI's $999 flat rate for unlimited users is a better long-term investment."
