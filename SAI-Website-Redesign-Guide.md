---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a complete website redesign and restructuring for strivetech.ai to transform it into a dedicated marketing platform for **SAI** (Strive AI), the all-in-one real estate platform designed specifically for real estate agents and teams.

**Key Change:** Transition from a generic AI consulting/services company website to a focused SaaS product marketing site for real estate professionals.

**Timeline:** Immediate implementation
**Scope:** Complete website overhaul including page structure, content, navigation, branding, and messaging

---

## Current Website Structure Analysis

### Existing Pages (To Be Removed/Modified)
- **Homepage/Hero** - Generic "Transform Your Business with AI" messaging
- **Services** - Lists consulting services, AI development, training, etc.
- **Solutions** - Generic solutions (not real estate specific)
- **Portfolio** - Case studies and service delivery work
- **About Us** - Company background
- **Contact** - Generic contact form

### Current Messaging Issues
1. **Industry Generic** - Doesn't speak to real estate challenges
2. **B2B Services Focused** - Emphasizes consulting and custom development
3. **Not Product-Focused** - Doesn't showcase SAI platform
4. **Wrong Audience** - Appeals to enterprises needing consulting, not agents
5. **Confusion About Core Business** - Unclear what Strive Tech actually sells

### Current Pain Points
- Hero section talks about "AI Solutions" not real estate platform
- Solutions page lists generic business problems
- Portfolio shows consulting work, not SaaS product
- No mention of real estate industry specifically
- No platform demo or feature showcase
- Navigation doesn't guide real estate professionals

---

#### Section B: The Problem We Solve

**Heading:** "Real Estate Agents: The Tech Stack Problem"

**Problem Statement:**
"Today's successful agents use 5-7 different tools just to do their job:
- CRM for contacts and leads → Salesforce, Follow-Up Boss
- Email marketing → Mailchimp, Klaviyo
- Social media scheduling → Buffer, Later
- Calendar/scheduling → Calendly, Google Calendar
- Document management → Dropbox, OneDrive
- Video conferencing → Zoom
- Market analysis → HouseCanary, Zillow
- Deal tracking → Custom spreadsheets

Each tool is a separate subscription. Different interfaces. Different data silos. Constant context switching. Hours spent managing tools instead of selling homes."
