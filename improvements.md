Add more padding / increase font size for The All-in-One Real Estate Platform. 

Add more wording for Built specifically for daily real estate workflows & Industry leading AI

Maybe get rid of Explore Features, since it is dragging right below where the button is

"Everything You Need, One Platform" needs more spacing between the text

Make the Coming Soon larger

Maybe increase the font size by 1 or 2  so (Exciting features on our roadmap to make your real estate business even more powerful) has more than 1 word on the bottom line

Make last white button into orange, so all Get started buttons / schedule a meeting are the same color (optional) 
not a must, but the left side navbar should stay in the lighter purple when being fully scrolled to the bottom of the page (I think it might look better)

# Pricing Page #
I say increase the font slightly for the titles (Competitive Analysis, Tool Calculator, etc) 
Add a little space between Simple, Transparent Pricing for Real Estate Teams

Remove all the extra -- between the sections -> @Claude please make it normalized text instead of using double hyphens. This goes for all text throughout the entire website.

# Company Page #
Add everyone's picture when you finally get them LOL -> @Claude don't worry about this right now since we still don't have everyones pictures.

# Contact Page #
