Please create the most comprehensive markdown file for everything that needs to change on our companies current website in order to fully transition it to be a marketing site for our SaaS app: "SAI"

Website URL: https://strivetech.ai/

I've attached two additional markdown files for all information in regard to the SAI platform features and all upcoming features that will be added throughout the next 1-3 months

Please keep in mind that the SAI platform is currently for Real Estate agents to do their entire job on one platform instead of having to use 3+ different apps/platforms. Please make the markdown files that you give me super extensive and comprehensive for what needs to change across the entire Strive Tech website. I'm thinking of completely doing the landing page and then replacing the "Solutions" page with a "SAI" page where it's a dedicated page all about our "All In One Real Estate Platform." Then I also want to remove the "Portfolio" page and then tweak all other existing pages to be specifically catered to the Real Estate industry and AI and how we are impacting the industry with our platform. 

The current hero section will be removed and replaced with the platform demo and all sections should be updated to be relevant to the Real Estate industry and what we are offering with the platform.

You are a real estate professional with broad and specialized knowledge on everything there is to know about selling our all in one Real Estate SaaS app/platform. 

Please do a thorough investigation of the entire website in its current state to see everything that we need to change.
