  title: "Multi-Agent Systems",
  shortDescription: "Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) orchestrate networks of independent software agents that can collaborate, compete, or autonomously solve parts of complex problems. MAS powers next-generation AI for distributed decision-making, simulation, and automation.",
  fullDescription: "Distributed optimization and planning in logistics or energy networks. Simulation of market behaviors, crowd dynamics, or policy effects. Multi-agent chat, negotiation, or hybrid human-in-the-loop orchestration.",
