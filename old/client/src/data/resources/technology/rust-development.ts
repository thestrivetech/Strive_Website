  title: "Rust Development",
  shortDescription: "Rust is a systems programming language focused on memory safety, performance, and concurrency without sacrificing speed. Ideal for high-performance backend services, blockchain applications, and system-level programming where security and efficiency are paramount for enterprise applications.",
  fullDescription: "High-Performance APIs: Build ultra-fast microservices and API gateways handling millions of requests with minimal resource usage. Blockchain Development: Create secure, efficient smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure with Rust's safety guarantees. System Tools: Develop CLI tools, system utilities, and infrastructure software requiring maximum performance and reliability.",
