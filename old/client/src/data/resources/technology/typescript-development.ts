  shortDescription: "TypeScript is Microsoft's statically typed superset of JavaScript that brings enterprise-grade type safety and advanced tooling to modern web development. Essential for large-scale applications, TypeScript reduces runtime errors, enhances developer productivity, and enables confident refactoring in complex codebases.",
  fullDescription: "Enterprise web applications, CRM systems, and business intelligence platforms with type safety. API development with strongly typed request/response contracts. Full-stack solutions sharing types between frontend and backend systems.",
