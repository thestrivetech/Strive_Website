  title: "WebSocket Real-time Communication",
  shortDescription: "WebSocket is a communication protocol providing full-duplex, real-time data exchange between client and server over a single TCP connection. Essential for interactive applications, WebSockets enable live chat, real-time analytics, collaborative editing, and instant notifications with minimal latency overhead.",
  fullDescription: "Real-time document editors, design tools, and project management platforms with instant synchronization. Financial applications with live market data, order execution, and portfolio updates. Real-time analytics dashboards, monitoring systems, and IoT device control panels.",
