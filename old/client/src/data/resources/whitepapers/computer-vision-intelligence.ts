  title: "Computer Vision: Visual Intelligence",
  shortDescription: "Enable machines to interpret and understand visual information for actionable business insights.",
  fullDescription: "Computer Vision technology enables computers to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs. By applying machine learning models to visual data, systems can identify objects, detect anomalies, and make decisions based on visual analysis. This guide covers state-of-the-art deep learning models including CNNs, YOLO, and Transformer-based architectures. Learn about object detection, image classification, facial recognition, motion tracking, and OCR capabilities that can revolutionize quality control, security monitoring, and customer experiences across industries.",
