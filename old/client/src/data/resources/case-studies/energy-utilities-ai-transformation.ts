  shortDescription: "Power company achieved 25% reduction in outages and 30% energy savings with AI-powered grid optimization.",
  fullDescription: "GridTech Energy, a regional utility serving 2.8 million customers across three states, revolutionized their operations through comprehensive AI implementation. Over 24 months, they deployed predictive maintenance systems, smart grid optimization, and AI-powered demand forecasting across their infrastructure. The transformation included real-time monitoring of 15,000+ grid components, automated load balancing, and intelligent outage prediction. Results included 25% reduction in power outages, 30% improvement in energy efficiency, 40% decrease in maintenance costs, and 99.2% grid reliability score. The implementation transformed their reactive maintenance approach into a predictive, data-driven operation that anticipates issues before they impact customers.",
