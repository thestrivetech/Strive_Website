**3.2 Availability**

We strive for 24/7 availability, but make no uptime guarantees, considering uptime can be out of our control, and 3rd party service providers may experience outages.

**Planned maintenance** (≥48 hours' notice), emergency maintenance (urgent security fixes), and third-party service failures are not breaches of any commitment.

**3.3 Electronic Signature Compliance**

"The Office" module handles documents and provides e-signature capabilities via 3rd party services, which follow the E-SIGN Act and are UETA compliant.

Document signing features comply with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN Act) and Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). By using electronic signature features, you:

\- Consent to conduct transactions electronically  
\- Acknowledge electronic signatures are legally binding  
\- Are responsible for ensuring signers consent to electronic signatures  
\- Must provide paper copies if requested by signers

**Our Responsibilities:**

- Use industry-standard password hashing (bcrypt or similar)  
- Offer MFA options (TOTP, SMS, WebAuthn)  
- Monitor for suspicious login patterns  
- Notify you of unrecognized logins or security events

**Liability:** You are responsible for all activities under your Account unless caused by our gross negligence. We are not liable if you fail to keep passwords confidential, enable MFA, or notify us of compromise.

**4.4 Organization Accounts**

If creating a multi-user organization account:

- **Organization is the "Customer"** responsible for all User activity and Fees  
- **OWNER role** (typically the Account creator) has full administrative rights and billing access  
- **ADMIN roles** can manage users and organization-wide data (but not billing)  
- **MEMBER roles** have access to standard features and their own data  
- **VIEWER roles** have limited access (document signing/viewing only, no CRM)

When an employee/agent relationship ends:

- The Organization retains ownership of organization-scoped data (billing, settings, templates)  
- The Organization may retain access to user-scoped data (CRM, deals) if employment agreements specify this  
- **Strive does not arbitrate data ownership disputes** between organizations and departing users

Before formal dispute resolution, try to resolve the issue through direct negotiation:

2. **Negotiation** – Both parties make good-faith efforts to resolve within 30 days

- **Location:** New Castle County, Delaware, OR your county of residence (your choice)  
- **Hearing:** By videoconference by default (Zoom, Teams), or in-person if requested  
- **Costs:** Split equally (filing fees, arbitrator fees); each party pays its own attorney fees unless law requires fee-shifting  
- **Decision:** Binding and final on both parties; arbitrator must issue written, reasoned award

**Exceptions to Arbitration:**

Either party may seek injunctive relief in court (without arbitration) for:

- IP infringement or trade secret misappropriation

You waive the right to:

- Bring or participate in class actions  
- Bring or participate in class arbitrations  
- Bring claims on behalf of other users or the general public  
- Consolidate claims with other claimants

**Each claim is arbitrated separately.**

**If the class action waiver is found unenforceable, the arbitration agreement is void, and all disputes will be resolved in court per Section 16.4.**

**Opt-Out Right (30 Days):** If you don't wish to arbitrate, email [contact@strivetech.ai](mailto:support@strivetechmail.com) with "Arbitration Opt-Out" within 30 days of accepting these Terms. If you opt out, disputes will be resolved in court per Section 16.4, and the class action waiver doesn't apply.

---

**16.4 Governing Law & Venue (If Litigation)**

**Governing Law:** These Terms are governed by Delaware law, without regard to conflict of law principles.

**Venue:** If arbitration doesn't apply, disputes will be resolved in Delaware state or federal courts (New Castle County, Delaware).

**Jury Trial Waiver:** Both parties waive the right to a jury trial. Disputes are decided by a judge.

**Exception for GDPR (future-only option):** If you're in the EU/UK, you retain the right to complain to your local supervisory authority (data protection authority) and pursue GDPR violations in local courts without restriction.

---

**17.4 No Waiver**

Our failure to enforce any provision is NOT a waiver of that right. Waivers must be in writing, signed by the party granting the waiver. A waiver in one instance doesn't waive the same right in future instances.

If any provision is found invalid or unenforceable:

2. ✅ **Fill in placeholders:**  
     
   - Company address  
   - Effective/Last Updated dates  
   - Current pricing details  
   - Any state-specific provisions needed

   

3. ✅ **Create separate Appendices documents** (A-I referenced above) for easy updates without revising ToS  
     
4. ✅ **Create supporting plain-language guides:**  
     
   - Executive Summary for real estate agents (1-2 pages)
