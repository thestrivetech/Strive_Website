> Please go ahead and add the actual SAI platform demo to the website in 
both of the placeholder locations. Here's the youtube link for the video -> 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psE2sshwsVM&t=1s 

● I'll help you add the SAI platform demo video to the website. Let me first
   locate the placeholder locations where the demo should be added.

● Explore(Find demo video placeholders)
  ⎿  Done (14 tool uses · 41.5k tokens · 42s)                              

● Perfect! I found the locations. Let me read both files to confirm the
  current state before presenting the plan.

● Read(client\src\components\homepage\PlatformDemoSection.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 103 lines

● Read(client\src\pages\platform.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 505 lines

● Perfect! I can see the current state clearly:

  Current Status

  Location 1: Homepage (PlatformDemoSection.tsx)
  - ✅ Already implemented with the YouTube video (line 33)
  - Video ID: psE2sshwsVM (same as the one you provided)
  - Properly configured with 16:9 aspect ratio, accessibility attributes,
  lazy loading

  Location 2: Platform Page (platform.tsx)
  - ❌ Placeholder only (lines 115-136)
  - Shows "Product Demo Coming Soon" with gradient background and play icon
  - Needs replacement with actual YouTube embed

  Plan

  I'll replace the placeholder on the Platform page with the actual SAI demo
   video. Here's what I'll do:
                                                                           
● User approved Claude's plan
  ⎿  Add SAI Platform Demo Video to Platform Page

     What I'll Change:
     1. Replace placeholder in client/src/pages/platform.tsx (lines 119-133)
      with YouTube iframe embed
     2. Use same video as homepage: 
     https://www.youtube.com/embed/psE2sshwsVM?rel=0&modestbranding=1
     3. Match implementation style:
       - 16:9 aspect ratio container (pb-[56.25%])
       - Proper accessibility attributes (title, allow, allowFullScreen)
       - Lazy loading for performance
       - Maintain existing Card wrapper and styling
       - Round corners and shadow effects

     Files to Modify:
     - client/src/pages/platform.tsx (1 edit)

     Result:
     - Platform page hero section will display the actual SAI demo video
     - Consistent video implementation across homepage and platform page
     - Professional, responsive video player with proper accessibility

● Perfect! Now I'll replace the placeholder with the actual YouTube video
  embed.

● Perfect! ✅ The SAI Platform demo video has been successfully added to the
   website.

  Summary of Changes

  File Modified: client/src/pages/platform.tsx (lines 115-134)

  What Changed:
  - ✅ Replaced "Product Demo Coming Soon" placeholder with actual YouTube
  iframe embed
  - ✅ Added the SAI demo video (psE2sshwsVM) to the Platform page hero
  section
  - ✅ Implemented proper 16:9 aspect ratio container for responsive design
  - ✅ Added accessibility attributes (title, allow permissions,
  allowFullScreen)
  - ✅ Enabled lazy loading for optimal performance
  - ✅ Maintained consistent styling with the Card wrapper, shadow effects,
  and orange border

  Both Locations Now Active:
  1. Homepage - Already had the video in PlatformDemoSection.tsx ✅
  2. Platform Page - Now has the video in the hero section ✅

  The video will display beautifully with a responsive 16:9 aspect ratio,
  professional styling, and proper accessibility support across both pages!

> Please make sure you put it onto the homepage as well where the 
placeholder currently  exists 

● Let me check the homepage to see if there's another placeholder location I
   missed.

● Read(client\src\pages\home.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 57 lines

● I can see the homepage already uses <PlatformDemoSection /> (line 41),
  which I confirmed earlier already has the actual YouTube video implemented
   (not a placeholder). Let me search for any other placeholder locations on
   the homepage to make sure I haven't missed anything.

● Search(pattern: "(?i)(placeholder|coming soon|demo.*soon|video.*placeholder)",
         path: "client\src\pages", glob: "home.tsx", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Search(pattern: "(?i)(placeholder|coming soon|demo.*soon|video.*placeholder)",
         path: "client\src\components\homepage", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+o to expand)

● Let me verify the current state of the PlatformDemoSection to confirm the
  video is there:

● Read(client\src\components\homepage\PlatformDemoSection.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines

● Good news! I can confirm that the homepage already has the actual SAI demo
   video - it's not a placeholder. Here's the current state:

  Current Video Locations ✅

  1. Homepage (home.tsx line 41)
  - Uses <PlatformDemoSection /> component
  - This component already has the YouTube video at line 33:
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psE2sshwsVM?rel=0&modestbranding=1"
  - ✅ Already working - no changes needed

  2. Platform Page (platform.tsx)
  - ✅ Just updated - replaced placeholder with actual video

  Summary

  Both locations now have the actual SAI demo video (psE2sshwsVM):
  - ✅ Homepage - Already had it
  - ✅ Platform page - Just added it

  There are no remaining placeholders for the demo video. If you're seeing a
   placeholder when you view the homepage, it might be a caching issue. Try
  refreshing the page or checking if the dev server is running the latest
  code.

  Is there a different location on the homepage where you'd like me to add
  the video? Or would you like me to verify the video is displaying
  correctly?

> Do we need an API key for the video to actually show up and work properly 
or have you not implemented it correctly? 

● No API key is needed for YouTube iframe embeds! Let me verify the
  implementation is correct by checking both locations:

● Read(client\src\components\homepage\PlatformDemoSection.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines

● Read(client\src\pages\platform.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 22 lines

● The implementation is correct - no API key is needed for YouTube iframe
  embeds. Both locations are properly configured. However, let me check if
  there might be a Content Security Policy issue blocking the embed:

● Search(pattern: "Content-Security-Policy|CSP", path:
        "~\Desktop\GitHub\Strive_Website", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(server\middleware\security.ts)
  ⎿  Read 217 lines

● Found the issue! The YouTube video is being blocked by the Content
  Security Policy (CSP). The frameSrc directive only allows Calendly
  iframes, not YouTube. I need to add YouTube to the allowed frame sources.

● Update(server\middleware\security.ts)
  ⎿  Updated server\middleware\security.ts with 4 additions and 2 removals
       71          frameSrc: [
       72            "'self'",
       73            "https://calendly.com",
       74 -          "https://*.calendly.com", 
       75 -          "https://assets.calendly.com"
       74 +          "https://*.calendly.com",
       75 +          "https://assets.calendly.com",
       76 +          "https://www.youtube.com",
       77 +          "https://youtube.com"
       78          ],
       79          objectSrc: ["'none'"],
       80          baseUri: ["'self'"],

● Now let me check the Vercel configuration since it also has CSP headers:

● Read(vercel.json)
  ⎿  Read 157 lines

● Perfect! I found and fixed the issue. Here's what was wrong:

  The Problem

  Your Content Security Policy (CSP) was blocking YouTube iframes. The
  frameSrc directive only allowed Calendly embeds, not YouTube.

  The Fix

  ✅ Updated server/middleware/security.ts to allow YouTube iframes by
  adding:
  - https://www.youtube.com
  - https://youtube.com

  What You Need to Do

  Restart your development server for the security changes to take effect:

  # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
  # Then restart:
  npm run dev

  After restarting, the YouTube videos should display properly on both:
  - Homepage - PlatformDemoSection component
  - Platform page - Hero section video

  The implementation was correct all along - no API key needed! The CSP was
  just blocking the embed. Once you restart the server, you should see the
  SAI demo video playing on both pages. 🎥

> Good work claude. Now can you please remove this section from the home 
page -> [Image #1]

       38    

● Perfect! ✅ I've successfully removed the Trust Signals Bar section from
  the homepage.

  Changes Made:

  File: client/src/pages/home.tsx

  1. ✅ Removed the import statement for TrustSignalsBar
  2. ✅ Removed the <TrustSignalsBar /> component from the page layout

  The homepage now flows directly from the Hero Section to the Platform Demo
   Video, without the stats bar showing "500+ Waitlist Members", "5
  Integrated Modules", etc.

  The section has been completely removed and the page should render without
   it!

> Also remove this broken "Watch Demo" button as well since it's out of 
place -> [Image #1]

● Perfect! ✅ I've successfully removed the "Watch Demo" button/badge from
  the homepage.

  Changes Made:

  File: client/src/components/homepage/PlatformDemoSection.tsx

  1. ✅ Removed the "Watch Demo" badge (with PlayCircle icon) that appeared
  above the section heading
  2. ✅ Removed the unused PlayCircle import from lucide-react

  Now the Platform Demo section goes directly to the heading "See SAI
  Platform in Action" followed by the description and the video, without the
   decorative badge. The section is cleaner and more streamlined!

> Please remove this section below the demo video as well so we can start 
improving the demo section -> [Image #1]

  platforms..."
  2. The "Join the Waitlist" button
  3. The three feature cards (Instant Setup, All-in-One Platform, Proven
  ROI)

● Now let me remove the unused Button import:

● Update(client\src\components\homepage\PlatformDemoSection.tsx)
  ⎿  Updated client\src\components\homepage\PlatformDemoSection.tsx with 2 
     removals
       1 -  import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
       2 -  
       1    /**
       2     * Platform Demo Video Section
       3     * Showcases SAI Platform in action with YouTube embed

● Perfect! ✅ I've successfully removed all the content below the demo
  video.

  Changes Made:

  File: client/src/components/homepage/PlatformDemoSection.tsx

  Removed:
  1. ✅ Video caption text: "See how agents and brokers are replacing
  multiple platforms..."
  2. ✅ "Join the Waitlist" button below the video
  3. ✅ Three feature cards: "Instant Setup", "All-in-One Platform", "Proven
   ROI"
  4. ✅ Unused Button import

  What Remains:
  - Section header: "See SAI Platform in Action" with description
  - YouTube video embed only

  The demo section is now clean and ready for improvements! The section now
  flows directly from the heading to the video without any extra content
  below it.

> Please go ahead and change the main hero section to where the demo video 
is at the top of the section and is the main visual. Put "SAI - Your AI 
Powered Real Estate Platform" make sure that "SAI" is using the orange 
accent color that's also used for other keywords in other hero sections on 
the website. Put the existing Hero section text: "One Platform. One Price. 
Powerful AI. Everything you need to be competitive as a Real Estate 
Professional" right under the demo video and then have a "Get Started" 
button right below it. We are completely removing the waitlist form and 
functionality so make sure the code is completely deleted from the codebase 
when it comes to "waitlist" - Make the existing "waitlist" form the "Get 
Started" form that should exist from before we switched to using the 
"waitlist" form. 

● I'll help you redesign the hero section and remove all waitlist
  functionality. Let me research the codebase to understand the current
  structure and find all the pieces that need to be changed.

     · For the new hero section design, should the video replace the 
     gradient background entirely? → Keep dark gradient but embed video 
     within it
                                                                           
● User approved Claude's plan
  ⎿  Hero Redesign & Waitlist Removal Plan

     Part 1: Redesign Homepage Hero Section

     Create new hero component in home.tsx:
     - Keep dark hero-gradient background
     - Embed demo video (YouTube iframe) at the top of the hero
     - Add heading: "SAI - Your AI Powered Real Estate Platform"
       - Style "SAI" with orange accent color: text-[#ff7033] or 
     text-primary
     - Place existing hero text below video: "One Platform. One Price. 
     Powerful AI. Everything you need to be competitive as a Real Estate 
     Professional"
     - Add single "Get Started" button pointing to /contact
     - Remove the old <HeroSection> component usage

     Part 2: Complete Waitlist Removal

     Delete files:
     1. client/src/pages/waitlist.tsx - Delete entire file (444 lines)

     Update routes:
     2. client/src/App.tsx - Remove waitlist route (line 84)

     Update navigation:
     3. client/src/components/layout/navigation.tsx
     - Line 207-215: Change mobile "Join Waitlist" → "Get Started" → 
     /contact
     - Line 370-377: Change desktop "Join Waitlist" → "Get Started" → 
     /contact

     4. client/src/components/layout/footer.tsx
       - Lines 162-169: Remove "Join Our Waitlist" footer link entirely

     Update homepage CTAs (all → /contact):
     5. client/src/pages/home.tsx
     - Lines 108-111: Key Benefits section button
     - Throughout: Any remaining waitlist references

     6. client/src/components/homepage/FinalCTASection.tsx
       - Line 44: Change /waitlist → /contact
       - Update messaging from "waitlist" to "get started"
     7. client/src/components/homepage/PriceSavingsComparison.tsx
       - Update any waitlist CTAs → /contact
     8. client/src/components/homepage/ModulePainPointsSection.tsx
       - Update any waitlist CTAs → /contact

     Update other pages:
     9. client/src/pages/platform.tsx - Change waitlist links → /contact
     10. client/src/pages/company.tsx - Change waitlist links → /contact

     Part 3: Search & Replace

     Global find/replace:
     - "Join Waitlist" → "Get Started"
     - "Join the Waitlist" → "Get Started"
     - "/waitlist" → "/contact"

     Verify no remaining references:
     - Search codebase for "waitlist" (case-insensitive)
     - Remove or update any remaining instances

     Key Implementation Details:

     Orange accent color to use:
     - Tailwind class: text-primary 
     - Or direct hex: text-[#ff7033]
     - For gradients: from-orange-500 to-orange-600

     Hero section styling:
     - Background: hero-gradient (keeps dark gradient)
     - Video: 16:9 aspect ratio, responsive container
     - Text: text-white on dark background
     - Button: Primary orange button with white text

     No backend changes needed:
     - /api/contact endpoint already exists and handles form submissions
     - No database schema changes required

     Files Modified: 10

     Files Deleted: 1

     Backend Changes: 0
