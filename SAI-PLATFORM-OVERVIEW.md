2. **crm.ts** - Contacts, leads, deals, activities
3. **the-office.ts** - Processes, parties, tasks, documents, compliance
4. **content-studio.ts** - Content, campaigns, emails, social posts
5. **reid.ts** - Market data, analyses, property insights
6. **ai.ts** - Conversations, messages, embeddings
7. **Supporting schemas** - Calendar, notifications, reminders, expenses

**30+ Tables Total** organized by business domain for optimal maintainability

---

### Data Ownership Models

**USER-OWNED (Primary for agents):**
- Contacts, leads, deals (CRM)
- Content created by agent (Content Studio)
- Expenses and tax records
- The Office processes (creator-owned)
- Conversations with SAI
- Personal calendars and reminders

**ORG-OWNED (Shared resources):**
- Process templates
- Email templates
- Document templates

- Team configurations
- Shared market data

**HYBRID:**
- REID analyses (user-owned) + market data (org-shared)
- Campaigns (creator-owned with sharing options)

**Why This Matters:**
Real estate is a relationship business. Agents own their "book of business" and contacts. SAI respects this by ensuring agents own their data, even within team settings. If an agent leaves a brokerage, their data can be transferred with them (with proper authorization).

---
