Website Improvements

# Home page #
Built for Real Estate section
Whole thing needs to be redesigned. This section doesn’t make me want to use SAI at all. 

## Data You Own section
Your data is secure instead of your data stays yours 

## AI That Actually Works section
This needs way more focus on all of the other AI throughout the platform as well as SaiBot. No one is purchasing a platform strictly for a chatbot. 

## Modules Section
Make sure these statistics are accurate

REID focus on High-Priority Listings and Deal Finder


Agent comparisons and how SAI helps them is a great value piece. Add one for comparing agent without SAI AI insights vs using SAI AI insights.

# Our Company page #
Change Q3 of roadmap to be another addition to the platform instead of a number goal

Add Jdub, Josh, and Eldo to Our Company page -> @Claude I will give you the pictures later in the session.
