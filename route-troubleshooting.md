Steps to Resolve Route Group Issue

Verify Route Group Structure
Ensure the route group folders (auth) and (platform) are correctly set up in the app/ directory. For example:
textapp/
├── (auth)/
│   └── login/
│       └── page.tsx
├── (platform)/
│   └── dashboard/
│       └── page.tsx
├── test/
│   └── page.tsx
└── page.tsx
Route groups in Next.js (App Router) should not affect URL paths (e.g., /login should still resolve correctly). If the structure is correct but pages return 404, Turbopack may be misinterpreting the route groups.
Option 1: Move Pages Out of Route Groups (Temporary Workaround)
To confirm if route groups are the issue, temporarily move the pages out of the (auth) and (platform) folders:

Move (auth)/login/page.tsx to app/login/page.tsx
Move (platform)/dashboard/page.tsx to app/dashboard/page.tsx
Then, restart the dev server (npm run dev) and check if http://localhost:3001/login and http://localhost:3001/dashboard load correctly.
Pros: Quick way to restore functionality without changing the build system.
Cons: Loses the organizational benefits of route groups.


Option 2: Switch from Turbopack to Webpack
Turbopack (Next.js's experimental replacement for Webpack) can have issues with newer features like route groups, especially in Next.js 15. To switch to Webpack:

Update the package.json dev script:
json"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev"
}
(Remove --turbopack if present.)
Clear the .next cache again: rm -rf .next
Restart the server: npm run dev
Test routes like http://localhost:3001/login and http://localhost:3001/dashboard.
Pros: Webpack is more stable for production apps and may resolve the 404 issue.
Cons: Slower build times compared to Turbopack.


Option 3: Update Next.js to the Latest Version
Check if a newer version of Next.js addresses the route group issue:

Run npm install next@latest to update to the latest stable version.
Clear the .next cache: rm -rf .next
Restart the dev server: npm run dev --turbopack (or without --turbopack if still testing Webpack).
Test the routes again.
Note: If you're already on Next.js 15, check the Next.js GitHub issues or X posts for reports of Turbopack route group bugs. You can also try the next@canary channel for cutting-edge fixes (use cautiously in production):
bashnpm install next@canary



Debugging Route Group Recognition
If the above options don’t resolve the issue:

Verify there are no typos in folder names (e.g., (auth) must use parentheses).
Check for conflicting middleware or next.config.js settings that might interfere with route resolution.
Run next dev with verbose logging to inspect route compilation:
bashnext dev --turbopack --log-level verbose

Look for errors or warnings related to (auth) or (platform) in the terminal output.



Recommendation
Start with Option 2 (Switch to Webpack), as Turbopack is experimental and more likely to cause issues with route groups in Next.js 15. If the issue persists, try Option 1 to confirm the route group setup is the root cause. Finally, consider Option 3 to check for fixes in newer Next.js versions, but only after verifying with Webpack.
Next Steps

Test one of the above options and confirm if /login and /dashboard routes resolve.
If the issue persists, share any relevant error messages from the terminal or browser console, or details about your app/ directory structure, and I can help narrow it down further.
